        03                 THE COURT REPORTER: (Requests
        04  counsel place stipulations on the record.)
        05                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Reserve,
        06  except form and foundation, the general Nebraska
        07  rule.
        08         (An off-the-record discussion was held.)
        09                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  This
        10  is the beginning of the deposition, the 30(b)(6)
        11  deposition of Volunteer Express.  Our witness
        12  today's name is Cory Lorincz.  Today's date is
        13  Wednesday, July 27, 2022.  The time right now is
        14  approximately 9:04 a.m. where the witness is,
        15  correct, Mr. Cory?
        16                 THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  Could
        17  you restate that?  Something popped up on my
        18  screen about the meeting being recorded.  I was
        19  trying to get it to go away.
        20                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  It's 9:05
        21  approximately where you are this morning, sir?
        22                 THE WITNESS:  Correct.
        23                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Would
        24  you go ahead and swear the witness and make any
        25  statements you need to, our court reporter.
  00006:01                  CORY LORINCZ,
        02  having been first duly sworn, was examined and
        03  testified as follows:
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Ryan,
        05  you may proceed.
        06                 MR. SKIVER:  Thank you.
        07                 DIRECT EXAMINATION
        08  BY MR. SKIVER:
        09       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, where are you currently
        10  located?
        11       A.   Birmingham, Alabama.
        12       Q.   I want to confirm that there is
        13  nobody in the room with you?
        14       A.   No, there is not.
        15       Q.   I also want to confirm that you do
        16  not have any other devices near you?
        17       A.   I do have two cell phones on the
        18  table to the side that are both turned off, and
        19  I have cancelled my email so nothing pops up on
        20  the screen.
        21       Q.   And it looks like that's not a smart
        22  watch that you have on, right?
        23       A.   No, it's a chronologic.
        24       Q.   All right.  And I see that you have
        25  some documents there for reference.
  00007:01       A.   Correct.  That's the production
        02  documents that were provided.
        03       Q.   So the --
        04       A.   I also have a blank notepad and an
        05  index with the Bates numbers of the documents.
        06       Q.   Okay.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to cut
        07  you off.  So that 883 pages that was produced,
        08  is that to your left?
        09       A.   Correct.
        10       Q.   Okay.  And then you said a notepad
        11  with nothing on it?
        12       A.   I wrote down everybody's names that's
        13  here at the meeting currently.
        14       Q.   Gotcha.
        15       A.   That's the only thing that's on the
        16  notepad.
        17       Q.   Okay.  And then to your right is an
        18  index of what's to your left, essentially?
        19       A.   Correct.
        20       Q.   Can you please state your name for
        21  the record?
        22       A.   Cory Michael Lorincz.
        23       Q.   Do you understand you are here to
        24  give a deposition regarding a lawsuit about a
        25  crash on November 2nd, 2017, involving Volunteer
  00008:01  Express's driver Erin Scott Connelly?
        02       A.   Yes.
        03       Q.   You understand, when I refer to the
        04  crash, I'm referring to the crash involving
        05  Volunteer Express's driver Connelly?
        06       A.   Yes.
        07       Q.   You understand that you are under
        08  oath and your testimony here today has the same
        09  force and effect as it would if we were in an
        10  actual courtroom, right?
        11       A.   Yes.
        12       Q.   Have you ever had your deposition
        13  taken before?
        14       A.   Yes.
        15       Q.   How many times?
        16       A.   Once.
        17       Q.   When was that?
        18       A.   That would have been approximately
        19  three -- well, four years ago.
        20       Q.   And what was that deposition in
        21  relation to?
        22       A.   It was in relation to a rear-end
        23  accident involving a driver named Mr. Edmunds
        24  that happened between Jacksonville, Tennessee,
        25  and Nashville, Tennessee.
  00009:01       Q.   Do you recall where that lawsuit took
        02  place?
        03       A.   It never went to lawsuit, to actual
        04  suit.  We ended up subrogating back
        05  approximately $87,000 from them for damages to
        06  our vehicle from rear-ending them.
        07       Q.   Oh, I'm sorry.  Your vehicle was
        08  rear-ended?
        09       A.   No, we rear-ended them.
        10       Q.   You rear-ended them.  And you said
        11  that you had a claim against them for 87,000?
        12       A.   Roughly 87,000 for damage to our
        13  truck and work comp expense for our employee.
        14       Q.   So that case wasn't in litigation,
        15  though?
        16       A.   Well, they had originally filed suit
        17  but then they never pursued suit with us and our
        18  driver ended up pursuing them and we enjoined
        19  the lawsuit against the other party.
        20       Q.   Where was that lawsuit filed
        21  originally?
        22       A.   Memphis, Tennessee.
        23       Q.   Was that in state court or federal
        24  court?
        25       A.   I don't recall.
  00010:01       Q.   Were you completely honest in your
        02  answers in that prior deposition?
        03       A.   Absolutely, yes.
        04       Q.   Okay.  There are a few rules for the
        05  deposition as we go forward.  I'm going to ask
        06  questions of you.  And if at any time you don't
        07  understand a word or a question, please stop me,
        08  let me know that you don't understand, and we
        09  will clarify the word or question so we're all
        10  on the same page.  Okay?
        11       A.   Understood.
        12       Q.   So if you answer a question, we will
        13  assume that you understood it.  Right?
        14       A.   Understood.
        15       Q.   And we have a court reporter here
        16  taking down everything we say, so you must give
        17  verbal answers.  Uh-huhs or head nods will not
        18  work.  If you do that, I may ask, Was that a
        19  yes?  And I'm not trying to influence your
        20  answer.  I just want to make sure the record is
        21  clear.  Okay?
        22       A.   Understood.
        23       Q.   If at any point you need a break, let
        24  us know, and we'll take a break as long as there
        25  isn't a pending question.  Okay?
  00011:01       A.   Understood.
        02       Q.   And like we discussed before, I'll
        03  probably take a break about every hour or so.
        04            Your attorney may object from time to
        05  time to preserve the record, but you still
        06  answer the question.  The objections will be
        07  ruled upon later by the judge.  Okay?
        08       A.   Understood.
        09       Q.   Have you ever had a commercial
        10  driver's license?
        11       A.   Yes.
        12       Q.   When did you get your commercial
        13  driver's license or CDL?
        14       A.   I believe the first time I got my
        15  commercial driver's license -- first and only
        16  time that I got my commercial driver's license
        17  would have been in 1999.
        18       Q.   Do you still have your CDL?
        19       A.   No, I do not.
        20       Q.   How did you get your CDL?  Did you go
        21  to truck driving school?
        22       A.   Yes.  I went to truck driving school
        23  in Indiana.
        24       Q.   What did you use to train for your
        25  CDL?
  00012:01       A.   They had information that they
        02  presented in a classroom presentation format as
        03  well as range and road training, and then you
        04  take a test for your CDL.
        05       Q.   Did they have a manual or anything
        06  that you worked off of?
        07       A.   I'm sure they did.  I don't recall if
        08  it was a paper manual or something on a
        09  computer.
        10       Q.   Was it through a specific trucking
        11  company?
        12       A.   No, it was not.  It was a private
        13  entity.
        14       Q.   What was the name of that private
        15  entity?
        16       A.   I don't recall exactly.  It had three
        17  initials.  TDS I think is what it was.
        18       Q.   Probably "Truck Drivers School" or
        19  something like that?
        20       A.   It was a very simple name, yes.
        21       Q.   Have you ever been in a crash while
        22  driving a commercial motor vehicle?
        23       A.   No.
        24       Q.   What is your highest level of
        25  education?
  00013:01       A.   I have a master's degree.
        02       Q.   What is your master's in?
        03       A.   Human resource management.  I also
        04  have several other certifications, if you need
        05  that information.
        06       Q.   What's your background in the
        07  trucking industry?
        08       A.   Well, I originally started driving
        09  truck as a flatbed truck driver.  Then I had an
        10  over-the-road flatbed truck driver.  I was on
        11  their safety support team.
        12            I became a local truck driver for a
        13  local company out of Livonia, Michigan, hauling
        14  DSD milk products.  During that period of time,
        15  I was promoted several times throughout the
        16  enterprise and given the opportunity to go into
        17  safety.
        18            I worked as a regional safety manager
        19  for a company called Quickway Carriers.  I also
        20  was the director of safety at Volunteer Express.
        21  While at Volunteer Express, I was awarded as one
        22  of J.J. Keller's safety professionals of the
        23  year for 2017.
        24            I was a secretary and then later the
        25  vice chair of the Tennessee Trucking
  00014:01  Association's Middle Tennessee Safety Council.
        02  I've attended numerous online as well as
        03  in-person orientation seminars and classes
        04  related to trucking and acted in a safety
        05  management role.
        06            Became a certified director of
        07  safety, then a Smith System certified trainer
        08  for the last, I believe, 11 years.  I would say
        09  11 years is correct.
        10            And now I work as vice president of
        11  safety at a company named SNL Distribution
        12  Services.
        13                 MR. SKIVER:  Did anyone else
        14  have their screen freeze up on them?  Mine did
        15  not, but Jim Harris said his did.
        16                 THE WITNESS:  Mine did not.
        17                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.
        18                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  No, not mine.
        19                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.  Just want to
        20  make sure.
        21                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Cory is
        22  frozen.
        23                 THE WITNESS:  No, I just wasn't
        24  moving.
        25                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  You must be a
  00015:01  ventriloquist.
        02                 THE WITNESS:  Oh.
        03                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay, so Jerry, you
        04  did have a freeze, but you could still hear him?
        05                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  I can hear
        06  him but he's -- the video, I guess is what the
        07  word is, is frozen on my screen.
        08                 MR. SKIVER:  Still currently?
        09                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Still
        10  currently.
        11                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  It's not on
        12  my screen.  This is Bill Roach, the
        13  videographer.  So if you want to proceed you can
        14  do so, as long as everybody can hear him, or we
        15  can take a break.  Whatever you choose, Ryan.
        16  You let us know.
        17                 MR. SKIVER:  Jerry, what do you
        18  feel comfortable with?
        19                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  I feel
        20  comfortable going ahead.
        21                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.
        22                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Well, let me
        23  ask this.  What's the remedy if it's just my
        24  screen?  Is it something I need to do on my end?
        25                 MR. THOMAS:  If the witness
  00016:01  turns his camera off and then back on, that
        02  should reset it.
        03                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  All right.
        04  Well, I hate to jeopardize the whole operation
        05  by trying that.
        06                 THE WITNESS:  Am I being
        07  instructed to turn the camera off and on on my
        08  side?
        09                 MR. SKIVER:  Why don't you do
        10  that, Cory, just to be safe, and see if that
        11  works for him.
        12                 THE WITNESS:  I'm assuming using
        13  the software program, right?  Not physically
        14  turn it off and on?
        15                 MR. SKIVER:  Right.  I think in
        16  the bottom left it should say "stop video," and
        17  then you can turn it back on.
        18            Jerry, did that work?
        19                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  It does.
        20                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.
        21                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Thank you.
        22                 MR. SKIVER:  Sure.
        23  BY MR. SKIVER:
        24       Q.   So as you know, we're here for a
        25  deposition about Volunteer Express.  What is the
  00017:01  proper name of Volunteer Express?
        02       A.   Volunteer Express, Inc.
        03       Q.   Is it okay if I simply refer to the
        04  company as Volunteer Express to make it easier
        05  for everybody?
        06       A.   (No audible response.)
        07       Q.   Is that a yes?
        08       A.   Yes.
        09       Q.   Okay.  When did you start working for
        10  Volunteer Express?
        11       A.   That would have been December 2014.
        12       Q.   How did you --
        13       A.   December 23rd, 2014, is when my
        14  moving PODS were delivered, and I believe I
        15  started the next day.
        16       Q.   Now, how did you get that job at
        17  Volunteer Express?
        18       A.   I interviewed for it and was offered
        19  the position.
        20       Q.   In 2017 what was your job title for
        21  Volunteer Express?
        22       A.   Director of safety.
        23       Q.   Did you ever work for Central Freight
        24  Lines?
        25       A.   The reason I'm thinking is because
  00018:01  Central Freight Lines purchased Volunteer
        02  Express's assets.  I did not work directly for
        03  them, no.
        04            I did work for a company, briefly,
        05  called Central Refrigerated as a driver many
        06  years ago.  So I was trying to remember if that
        07  company was Central Refrigerated or Central
        08  Freight years ago, but it was Central
        09  Refrigerated.
        10            But no, I did not work for Central
        11  Freight.
        12       Q.   Do you know if any of the employees
        13  from Volunteer Express went over to work for
        14  Central Freight?
        15       A.   It's my understanding that many of
        16  them did.
        17       Q.   But you did not?
        18       A.   No, I did not.
        19       Q.   Why not?
        20       A.   I was offered a higher position at
        21  another company.
        22       Q.   Sorry.  Just a background question I
        23  have to ask, no offense intended.  Have you ever
        24  been charged with a crime?
        25       A.   No.
  00019:01                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.  If we could
        02  please pull up 01, the amended 30(b)(6) notice.
        03  And I believe we will mark this as Exhibit 8.
        04                 (Exhibit No. 8 marked for
        05                  identification.)
        06  BY MR. SKIVER:
        07       Q.   You have in front of you what has
        08  been marked as Exhibit 8.  That's the notice of
        09  Rule 30(b)(6) deposition we are here for today.
        10  Have you seen this notice before?
        11       A.   I don't have that document in front
        12  of me or on the screen currently.
        13       Q.   Okay.
        14                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, do you know
        15  why it's not sharing with him?  I've got it.
        16                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Cory, what do
        17  you see on your screen?
        18                 THE WITNESS:  I see me.
        19                 MR. SKIVER:  Looks like Cory has
        20  his pinned.
        21                 THE WITNESS:  If I recall
        22  correct, at the beginning Bill had stated he was
        23  going to pin my video to the screen.  Maybe
        24  that's why I cannot see it.
        25                 MR. SKIVER:  So there's a
  00020:01  difference between a spotlight and a pin.  I see
        02  a pin in your lower left corner.  So usually the
        03  person does it for themselves for a pin, but a
        04  spotlight does it for everyone.
        05                 THE WITNESS:  How do I change
        06  that if I need to change something here?
        07                 MR. SKIVER:  Let's see.
        08                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Can we go off
        09  the record for a moment?
        10                 MR. SKIVER:  Sure.
        11                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going
        12  off the record.  The time is approximately
        13  9:19 a.m.
        14         (At 9:19 a.m. - Recess)
        15  
        16  
        17  
        18  
        19  
        20  
        21  
        22  
        23  
        24  
        25  
  00021:01         (At 9:21 a.m., with all parties present
        02  as before, the following proceedings were had,
        03  to-wit:)
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on
        05  the record at approximately 9:21 a.m.  You may
        06  proceed, sir.
        07  BY MR. SKIVER:
        08       Q.   You have in front of you what has
        09  been previously marked as Exhibit 8, that is the
        10  notice of Rule 30(b)(6) deposition we are here
        11  for today.  Have you seen this notice before?
        12       A.   Can I hit the view button so I can
        13  see it?
        14       Q.   Yes, you can do whatever you need to
        15  to be able to see that.
        16       A.   The view button disappeared on my
        17  screen when he hit the record.  I don't know how
        18  to get it on my screen.  Oh, wait.  Hang on.
        19  There's the view button.  All right.  It did not
        20  share.  There it is.  Okay.
        21       Q.   Have you seen this notice before?
        22       A.   Can you scroll down through the
        23  notice a little bit so I can -- I've looked at a
        24  lot of these in the past.  I want to make sure
        25  I've actually seen this specific one.
  00022:01            Yes.  Yes, I believe I have.
        02       Q.   When did you first see this notice of
        03  Rule 30(b)(6) deposition?
        04       A.   I believe this was sent to me --
        05  honestly, I don't recall exactly when I received
        06  it.
        07       Q.   You have had the opportunity to go
        08  through it, though, correct?
        09       A.   Yes.
        10       Q.   You understand that Exhibit 8, the
        11  30(b)(6) deposition notice, requires Volunteer
        12  Express to designate a person to testify on its
        13  behalf?
        14       A.   Correct, yes.
        15       Q.   You understand that the answers you
        16  give here today, under oath, are for all
        17  purposes deemed to be the answers of Volunteer
        18  Express?
        19       A.   Yes.
        20       Q.   Do you understand that Volunteer
        21  Express was required to fully prepare you to
        22  provide all information known or reasonably
        23  available to Volunteer Express in response to
        24  the matters listed in that deposition notice?
        25       A.   Yes.
  00023:01       Q.   What did you do to prepare to provide
        02  all the information known or reasonably
        03  available to Volunteer Express in response to
        04  the matters listed in the deposition notice?
        05       A.   I reviewed all of the documentation
        06  that was provided through production.  And
        07  the -- some of the emails in the production
        08  documents.
        09            While doing so I did come across one
        10  that stated what happened to our ELD, and I'm
        11  not sure if that one has been provided or not.
        12            But other than that, I had a
        13  conversation with Mr. Friedrichsen on reviewing
        14  the documentation that we had in front of us
        15  from this production.
        16       Q.   Okay.  You said that you've located
        17  an email about "What happened to our ELD."  I
        18  have not seen that as part of the production.
        19  Can you please provide that to us?
        20                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  I will do
        21  that, Ryan.
        22  BY MR. SKIVER:
        23       Q.   Do you recall what that document said
        24  about what happened to the electronic log data?
        25       A.   Well, it was actually the electronic
  00024:01  log device, because we kept the log device to
        02  make sure it had never been downloaded or
        03  tampered with or anything of the sort.  And
        04  after three years and after the sale of --
        05  actually, I believe it was prior to the sale of
        06  Volunteer Express's assets, it was authorized to
        07  be put into another truck.
        08            I was not the person that authorized
        09  it to be put in another truck, and I do not know
        10  that the person that did authorize it knew
        11  exactly what it was for.
        12       Q.   Who authorized the ELD from the truck
        13  in this crash to be put into another truck?
        14       A.   That was Harry Crabtree.
        15       Q.   Who is Harry Crabtree?
        16       A.   He works for Paladin Capital.
        17       Q.   Who is Paladin Capital?
        18       A.   Paladin Capital is -- owns the
        19  company that runs our shops or ran our shop at
        20  Volunteer Express.
        21       Q.   When you say Paladin Capital owns the
        22  company that runs -- ran your shop at Volunteer
        23  Express, are you talking about the trucking
        24  company or, like, the maintenance department or
        25  something like that?
  00025:01       A.   The maintenance department is
        02  considered to be a company called Capital City
        03  Leasing, which is owned by Paladin, and it was
        04  in the director of maintenance's office for
        05  Capital City Leasing.
        06       Q.   Who is the director of maintenance?
        07       A.   At that time it would have been Shane
        08  Depperman.
        09       Q.   Can you spell that name for us
        10  please?
        11       A.   S-H-A-N-E, D-E-P-P-E-R-M-A-N.
        12       Q.   Where was the ELD from the truck in
        13  this crash being kept by the director of
        14  maintenance, Mr. Depperman?
        15       A.   It was in a box labeled "16127" in
        16  his office.
        17       Q.   Was there anything else indicating
        18  that it was to be preserved for the litigation
        19  in this case?
        20       A.   I'm not sure if there was any
        21  specific notations on the box other than the
        22  truck number and his knowledge and my knowledge
        23  that that's what that ELD was for.
        24       Q.   So the ELD from the truck in this
        25  crash was not secured in any other way besides
  00026:01  being put into a box and the number of the truck
        02  being indicated on it, as far as you know,
        03  correct?
        04       A.   In a locked office, yes.
        05       Q.   But other people had access to that
        06  locked office, correct?
        07       A.   I don't know if they did or did not.
        08       Q.   Well, obviously, since --
        09       A.   I can't answer that because I wasn't
        10  the person that had the keys to that office.
        11       Q.   Well, Mr. Crabtree obviously had
        12  access to that office, true?
        13       A.   Mr. Crabtree instructed via email
        14  that it was okay to use that system in a
        15  different truck.  But I cannot tell you if he
        16  did or did not have access to that office.  It
        17  was not my office.
        18       Q.   Do you know who Mr. Crabtree
        19  instructed that it was okay to use the ELD from
        20  the truck involved in this crash?
        21       A.   Mr. Shane Depperman.
        22       Q.   Did Mr. Depperman respond to that
        23  email from Mr. Crabtree?
        24       A.   I don't recall word for word what was
        25  on the email.  I know that he had stated -- it
  00027:01  was a request from me looking for the ELD for
        02  production, you know, scenarios like this, in
        03  which I was informed by Mr. Depperman through an
        04  email, where he sent me an email that Harry had
        05  authorized him to put it in another truck after
        06  three years being sitting there in the office.
        07       Q.   So your understanding is that the ELD
        08  from the truck involved in this crash has now
        09  been used and overwritten?
        10       A.   I would understand that reusing it in
        11  another truck would overwrite it, yes.
        12       Q.   So then evidence has been destroyed?
        13                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        14  form of the question.  Argumentative.
        15  BY MR. SKIVER:
        16       Q.   Could you please answer the question?
        17       A.   Oh, overwriting it would destroy
        18  anything that's on the ELD.
        19       Q.   So you've mentioned the documents
        20  that were disclosed, the 883 pages that are to
        21  your left, as well as that additional email.
        22  Were there any other documents that were
        23  reviewed in preparation for your deposition
        24  today?
        25       A.   I reviewed this -- the -- I guess
  00028:01  this is called a Bates index, I guess, is what
        02  this thing is called.
        03       Q.   And was that a Bates index that your
        04  attorney provided to you?
        05       A.   Correct.
        06       Q.   And that just has the Bates numbers
        07  from Volunteer Express 000001 through 000883?
        08       A.   Yeah, they don't have the zeros on
        09  there.  There are two other documents that it's
        10  my understanding were sent to you as well that
        11  we numbered 884 and 885 just with an ink pen
        12  that are the carrier scorecard for CSA BASICs.
        13  Those were also reviewed.
        14       Q.   Any other documents?
        15       A.   I apologize.  I had them stapled to
        16  the back of this, and I almost forgot about
        17  them.
        18       Q.   That's fine.  Any other documents,
        19  besides the ones we've discussed so far, that
        20  you reviewed in preparation for the deposition
        21  today?
        22       A.   I believe everything that I reviewed
        23  was information that we've already disclosed.
        24       Q.   You mention that you talked to your
        25  attorney, obviously.  Did you talk with anybody
  00029:01  else in preparation for this deposition today?
        02       A.   No.  Let me clarify that.  In
        03  relation to the actual deposition or contents
        04  thereof, no.  But I did inform my boss I had a
        05  deposition that needed to be taken.  So I did
        06  mention, yes, that, you know, I'm doing this
        07  right now.
        08       Q.   So are you at your new company in a
        09  room or an office somewhere?
        10       A.   Correct, in our conference room, yes.
        11       Q.   And that's SNL Distribution?
        12       A.   Correct.
        13       Q.   So you understand you are
        14  representing the corporation Volunteer Express
        15  in this deposition and not yourself?
        16       A.   Correct.
        17       Q.   Do you understand that all of the
        18  answers you will give to our questions will
        19  represent all of the information available to
        20  Volunteer Express?
        21       A.   Yes.
        22       Q.   Are you aware that the answers you
        23  will give to our questions will be binding upon
        24  Volunteer Express?
        25       A.   Yes.
  00030:01       Q.   Who chose you to be the corporate
        02  representative for Volunteer Express?
        03       A.   Honestly, let me think here.  Harry
        04  Crabtree would have been the person that told me
        05  that I needed to be the representative for
        06  Volunteer Express.
        07       Q.   When did Harry Crabtree tell you you
        08  would be the corporate representative for
        09  Volunteer Express?
        10       A.   Throughout my entire career at
        11  Volunteer Express and upon my departure, letting
        12  me know that if any cases came up, they would
        13  request me to represent Volunteer Express.
        14       Q.   So you got told right away,
        15  basically, you're the guy, you're going to have
        16  to do this if we have any of these?
        17       A.   Yes, because I was the person that
        18  worked there during that time.
        19       Q.   I want to make it clear that over the
        20  course of this deposition, when I use the term
        21  "you," I'm referring to Volunteer Express and
        22  not you personally unless I say "you
        23  personally."  Is that understood?
        24       A.   Understood.
        25       Q.   And I believe that you said that your
  00031:01  position with Volunteer Express or your title
        02  was director of safety?
        03       A.   Correct.
        04       Q.   So as Volunteer Express's director of
        05  safety, you were their safety expert?
        06       A.   Yes.
        07       Q.   So you are familiar with the Federal
        08  Motor Carrier Safety Regulations?
        09       A.   Yes, I am.
        10       Q.   Are you familiar with J.J. Keller's
        11  materials on trucking?
        12       A.   Not all of them, because they have a
        13  vast library of documentation.  But I am very
        14  aware of J.J. Keller and we did utilize some of
        15  their documentation in training.
        16       Q.   So you consider J.J. Keller's
        17  materials to be a reliable source of
        18  information?
        19       A.   They are the world's leader of --
        20  leading source of materials.  Not everybody
        21  agrees with their interpretations because a lot
        22  of this -- a lot of the companies out there have
        23  their own interpretations on regulations even.
        24            When I have an issue with
        25  interpretation, I seek clarification directly
  00032:01  from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        02  Administration.
        03       Q.   Do you generally --
        04       A.   They are the expert.
        05       Q.   Do you generally consider J.J.
        06  Keller's materials to be reliable with regards
        07  to trucking?
        08       A.   They are reasonable.  But sometimes
        09  they are missing information that's pertinent.
        10       Q.   Do you consider J.J. Keller's
        11  materials to be reliable with regards to
        12  trucking, yes or no?
        13                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        14  form of the question.  It can't be answered yes
        15  or no.
        16       A.   I can't answer that yes or no because
        17  some of them I wouldn't use personally and some
        18  of them I would.  But some of theirs is and some
        19  of theirs is not.
        20  BY MR. SKIVER:
        21       Q.   What materials of J.J. Keller's do
        22  you find to not be reliable?
        23       A.   Okay.  For example, recently they
        24  sent out a notification document, white paper,
        25  if you would, on what you need to have in a
  00033:01  driver qualification file.  I found it to be
        02  incomplete and told my staff not to use it
        03  because there is much more information that's
        04  required to be in there from a best practices
        05  standpoint as well as from an FMCSA standpoint.
        06  They are typically the bare minimum on a lot of
        07  things.
        08       Q.   So J.J. Keller materials are
        09  typically the bare minimum when it comes to
        10  trucking?
        11       A.   Some are and some are not.  I find
        12  their hazardous materials information to be
        13  great, but some of their other information I do
        14  not.  That's why -- it's such a broad question,
        15  I can't really give a yes or no answer to it.
        16       Q.   What other materials from J.J. Keller
        17  do you find to not be reliable?
        18       A.   Off the top of my head, that's a very
        19  broad category, and I have not reviewed all of
        20  J.J. Keller's materials to be able to tell you
        21  off the top of the head which ones I have
        22  discarded from use and which ones I haven't.
        23  The recent example of the white paper was from a
        24  week and a half ago or so.
        25       Q.   Are you familiar with the Smith
  00034:01  System?
        02       A.   Absolutely, yes, I am.
        03       Q.   Is the Smith System a reliable source
        04  for driving a truck safely?
        05       A.   Smith System is an interpretation of
        06  defensive driving skills that can be utilized by
        07  a driver to help them drive safely.  There are
        08  numerous other systems just like it.  So yes, it
        09  is good information.  It is not the definitive
        10  information.
        11       Q.   Is the Smith System a reliable source
        12  for driving a truck safely?
        13       A.   It's a reliable source for educating
        14  drivers on driving a truck safely.  But again,
        15  it's just taught skills.
        16       Q.   Are there any skills that are taught
        17  in the Smith System that a truck driver should
        18  not follow?
        19       A.   In my opinion, I would say that the
        20  honking of the horn to get attention of people
        21  that are walking down the sidewalk can be
        22  unnecessary as well as distracting to that
        23  person and could cause them to make a decision
        24  that they otherwise wouldn't.
        25            People make sudden reactions when
  00035:01  they are startled.  And the Smith System
        02  advocates a lot of honking of your horn.  In
        03  some scenarios it's great.  Backing up, it's a
        04  good thing to do.  But when you are trying to
        05  get the attention of a pedestrian that's walking
        06  across the road or starting to walk across the
        07  road or walking down a sidewalk, it may not be
        08  the best approach.
        09            And that varies in who teaches the
        10  class how they present that information.
        11       Q.   And you actually are a Smith System
        12  trainer, true?
        13                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, it looks like
        14  your picture popped up here for some reason.
        15                 THE COURT REPORTER:  I think we
        16  lost the witness.
        17                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the
        18  video.  The time is now approximately 9:38 a.m.
        19         (At 9:38 a.m. - Recess)
        20  
        21  
        22  
        23  
        24  
        25  
  00036:01         (At 9:42 a.m., with all parties present
        02  as before, the following proceedings were had,
        03  to-wit:)
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the
        05  video record at 9:42 a.m.  You may proceed,
        06  Ryan.
        07  BY MR. SKIVER:
        08       Q.   You are a Smith System trainer, true?
        09       A.   I am certified as an instructor in
        10  the Smith System, yes.
        11       Q.   And besides honking, is there
        12  anything that you think a driver should not
        13  follow with regards to the Smith System?
        14       A.   I think that everything in the Smith
        15  System, except for the use of the honking, is
        16  beneficial.
        17       Q.   Are you familiar with the National
        18  Safety Council?
        19       A.   Yes, I'm familiar with them.
        20       Q.   How long did you work for Volunteer
        21  Express?
        22       A.   Approximately five years.
        23       Q.   Earlier you said that you had seen a
        24  lot of those 30(b)(6) notices.
        25       A.   Well, I have seen a lot of court
  00037:01  documents, and they all look the same after a
        02  while, so you really kind of have to look at
        03  them to see what they are.
        04       Q.   Do you know how many 30(b)(6) notices
        05  you've seen?
        06       A.   Is 30(b)(6) specific to Nebraska?
        07       Q.   30(b)(6) is the rule for a corporate
        08  representative to be giving a deposition.
        09       A.   Gotcha.  I cannot recall how many I
        10  would have seen.  I can assume I would have seen
        11  one for that last deposition that I mentioned
        12  previously.
        13       Q.   Do you know if you've seen more than
        14  that?
        15       A.   No, I have not.
        16       Q.   What specific type of work does
        17  Volunteer Express perform?
        18       A.   Volunteer Express was an LTL carrier,
        19  less-than-truckload freight, door-to-door
        20  delivery, shuttle runs in between terminals and
        21  some OTR.  "OTR" meaning over the road.
        22       Q.   Thank you for clarifying for the
        23  jury.
        24            What is Volunteer Express's USDOT
        25  number?
  00038:01       A.   36784.
        02       Q.   Volunteer Express is required to
        03  follow the FMCSRs, true?
        04       A.   Correct, yes.
        05       Q.   And by "FMCSRs," I mean Federal Motor
        06  Carrier Safety Regulations.  You understood
        07  that, right?
        08       A.   Correct.
        09       Q.   How long has Volunteer Express been
        10  in business?
        11       A.   Volunteer Express I believe was
        12  founded in 1973.
        13       Q.   Can you please give us just kind of a
        14  brief history of Volunteer Express?
        15       A.   Volunteer Express started in
        16  Dyersburg, Tennessee, with two trucks and grew
        17  to ten terminals in one, two, three, four
        18  states.  They grew from having about five
        19  drivers to, at their largest size, I believe,
        20  220 or so.  During my tenure would have been the
        21  220ish.
        22       Q.   The 220 drivers?
        23       A.   Yes.
        24       Q.   What's the corporate structure for
        25  Volunteer Express?
  00039:01       A.   The past corporate structure, right?
        02       Q.   Yeah.  So --
        03       A.   Can you clarify?
        04       Q.   Yeah, let me clarify for this.
        05  Because, you know, the relevant time is around
        06  this crash.  So just to make it easier, I'm
        07  going to be talking kind of in the present
        08  tense, because we're only going to be talking
        09  about that time period.
        10       A.   I see.
        11       Q.   And when I talk -- yeah, when I talk
        12  about corporate structure, I'm just kind
        13  of trying to get a background of, like, is there
        14  a CEO?  Is there a president?  Is there a board?
        15  That type of thing.
        16       A.   Yeah, understandable.  The president
        17  at that time was Rick Baker.  We had two vice
        18  presidents, one of sales and one of operations.
        19  That would have been Mr. Dan Johnson, who I
        20  believe at that time was over sales, and
        21  Mr. Matt Bowen, who was over operations.  At
        22  times they had switched positions, from sales
        23  and operations, between the two.  I don't recall
        24  exactly when that happened.
        25            I reported directly to the president
  00040:01  of the company as director of safety.  We also
        02  had director of sales.  We had -- let's see
        03  here.  We had a director of operations as well.
        04  And from there down would have been terminal
        05  managers, dispatchers, then office personnel,
        06  and drivers.
        07            We also had it broke into two
        08  divisions, which would have been the OTR
        09  truckload division and the LTL division.
        10       Q.   So it sounds like there is the
        11  president at the top and then that next level is
        12  the directors like you are, is that right?
        13       A.   Typically, it's the vice presidents.
        14  But safety reported directly to the president.
        15       Q.   Okay.  So it goes, like, president,
        16  two vice presidents, and then the directors, but
        17  the directors go straight to the president?
        18       A.   No.  My position was at the same
        19  level as the vice presidents in who we reported
        20  to.  But the director -- rest of the directors
        21  reported to operations, typically.
        22       Q.   Gotcha.  So the rest of those
        23  directors go to whoever was the vice president
        24  of operations at that time?
        25       A.   Correct.
  00041:01       Q.   So 2017, how many trucks or power
        02  units does Volunteer Express have?
        03       A.   I don't recall the exact number, but
        04  I can give you an estimate if you'd like.
        05       Q.   Yeah.  And give me your best
        06  estimates or approximations, and you can tell me
        07  that it's approximately, if you'd like, in
        08  response.
        09       A.   I believe we had approximately 180
        10  tractors at that time.  And did you say trailers
        11  as well?
        12       Q.   Sorry.  Let me ask that question
        13  again just to make it clear.
        14            How many trucks or power units does
        15  Volunteer Express have?
        16       A.   At that time, approximately 180 power
        17  units.
        18       Q.   How many trailers does Volunteer
        19  Express have?
        20       A.   I don't recall the exact number.  It
        21  was a lot.
        22       Q.   So more than 200?
        23       A.   Yes.  Approximately, thinking off the
        24  top of my head, I would think that number would
        25  have been closer to 500.
  00042:01       Q.   And I believe you said earlier
        02  Volunteer Express has approximately 220 drivers?
        03       A.   Yes.  That number fluctuates a little
        04  with hiring, but somewhere between 190 and 220
        05  is where it stayed.
        06       Q.   How many deliveries, on average, does
        07  Volunteer Express make on a daily basis?
        08       A.   I couldn't give you an answer to that
        09  question.  The number of deliveries on every
        10  stop varied.  And the number of drivers that
        11  were performing direct deliveries versus drop
        12  and hooks, things like that, I don't know the
        13  exact number that were done.
        14            I can tell you that the typical DSD,
        15  you know, direct delivery driver, would have
        16  anywhere between 2 and 12 to maybe 14 stops in a
        17  day, as to where a shuttle driver between our
        18  terminals would usually go maybe one to two
        19  stops a day.  And an OTR driver, they might not
        20  have a stop for five days.
        21       Q.   And I believe you said that Volunteer
        22  Express was located in four states?
        23       A.   We had location -- terminal locations
        24  in four states.
        25       Q.   How many states did Volunteer Express
  00043:01  drive in?
        02       A.   All of them except for California,
        03  Alaska, and Hawaii.
        04       Q.   Why not California?
        05       A.   Their regulatory demands make it too
        06  expensive to operate there because we would have
        07  had to modify our equipment in order to do so.
        08       Q.   And Volunteer Express is familiar
        09  with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        10  Regulations, true?
        11       A.   Yes.
        12       Q.   What are the Federal Motor Carrier
        13  Safety Regulations?
        14                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        15  form of the question, overly broad.
        16       A.   The Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        17  Regulations are a group of I guess you would
        18  call them rules and regulations that were put
        19  together as part of the Code of Federal
        20  Regulations and are used for the I guess you
        21  would say governance, to some extent, of the
        22  transportation sector.  They don't just cover
        23  trucking, but the portion we refer to does.
        24  BY MR. SKIVER:
        25       Q.   And the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
  00044:01  Regulations are safety rules that Volunteer
        02  Express must follow, true?
        03       A.   They are not all safety rules, but
        04  the focus is safety, yes.  But we are required
        05  to follow the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        06  Regulations.
        07       Q.   The Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        08  Regulations are also recognized as a minimum
        09  standard in trucking, true?
        10       A.   That's correct.  We usually went
        11  above and beyond the standard.
        12       Q.   Volunteer Express must require its
        13  drivers to follow the Federal Motor Carrier
        14  Safety Regulations too, correct?
        15       A.   Yes.
        16       Q.   Are you familiar with the form OP-1
        17  application for authority?
        18       A.   OP-1 application for authority.  Have
        19  I seen one?  Yes.  Am I familiar with it?  I
        20  don't -- I can't quote it.  I can't tell you
        21  what it says on it specifically.
        22            I know that there were multiple
        23  versions of authority from the '70s and '80s on
        24  upward, documentwise, where they would get
        25  renewals or they would get different documents.
  00045:01            If it's called an OP-1, then that's
        02  what it would be called, but I'm not sure.  I
        03  can't tell you that that's what it's called.
        04       Q.   Volunteer Express was required to
        05  verify, under penalty of perjury, that it has in
        06  place a system and individual responsible for
        07  ensuring compliance with the FMCSRs, true?
        08       A.   Yes.
        09       Q.   Does Volunteer Express have a system
        10  in place to ensure compliance with the FMCSRs?
        11       A.   Yeah, we have a very evolved safety
        12  program that -- that is much stricter and much
        13  more in-depth than most companies.
        14       Q.   What is Volunteer Express's system to
        15  ensure compliance with the FMCSRs?
        16       A.   That's -- that's a broad question,
        17  but management controls over the safety
        18  processes related to our drivers, and there are
        19  numerous different management controls that were
        20  in place.
        21       Q.   And still, throughout this
        22  deposition, I'm going to be asking questions.
        23  They may be broad.  They may be specific.  I'm
        24  not asking you to comment on the type of
        25  question.  I'm simply asking for an answer to
  00046:01  the question.  Okay?
        02       A.   Understood.
        03       Q.   Are Volunteer Express's system to
        04  ensure compliance with the FMCSRs in a written
        05  document somewhere?
        06       A.   Yes and no.
        07       Q.   Please explain.
        08       A.   They are in several written
        09  documents.
        10       Q.   Okay.  So Volunteer Express's system
        11  to ensure compliance with the FMCSRs are in
        12  several written documents, true?
        13       A.   Yes.
        14       Q.   Are Volunteer Express's system to
        15  ensure compliance with the FMCSR in an
        16  electronic form?
        17       A.   The documents are in electronic form.
        18  That's what we downloaded and forwarded for
        19  production, yes.
        20       Q.   Okay.  So are all of the documents
        21  that ensure compliance with the FMCSRs included
        22  in the 883 pages you've provided?
        23       A.   Everything that I could locate, yes.
        24       Q.   Who is the individual responsible for
        25  ensuring compliance with the Federal Motor
  00047:01  Carrier Safety Regulations at Volunteer Express?
        02       A.   Director of safety, Cory Lorincz.
        03       Q.   Are you familiar with the form SC --
        04  excuse me.  Strike that.
        05            Are you familiar with the form
        06  MCS-150?
        07       A.   MCS-150?  There are several MCS
        08  forms.  Could you clarify which form that is?
        09       Q.   Sure.
        10       A.   Is that the insurance form, or is
        11  that the update to the motor carrier for the
        12  number of trucks and trailers?  I believe that's
        13  what the MCS-150 is, but there is also an MCS
        14  190 that's related to insurance.
        15            So MCS-150 should be the annual
        16  update that is provided to the FMCSA on a
        17  biannual basis to tell them the number of
        18  trucks, drivers, trailers, type of operation,
        19  et cetera.
        20       Q.   Volunteer Express is required to
        21  certify that it is familiar with the Federal
        22  Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, true?
        23       A.   I do not recall if there is a
        24  specific box or document that says do you or are
        25  you going to be.  But it is obviously implied,
  00048:01  and everyone understands that's what we're
        02  supposed to do, yes.
        03       Q.   Does Volunteer Express have a system
        04  in place to make sure its drivers are familiar
        05  with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        06  Regulations?
        07       A.   Yes.
        08       Q.   What is the system to make sure
        09  Volunteer Express's drivers are familiar with
        10  the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations?
        11       A.   Our orientation training program and
        12  recurrent training processes.
        13       Q.   What are the recurrent training
        14  processes?
        15       A.   Recurrent training processes would be
        16  in-person classes or meetings and/or the online
        17  classes that we would provide to an individual
        18  while they were employed, typically periodically
        19  ranging from every month to every quarter or
        20  every six months, depending on the number and
        21  quantity of things that we wanted to put in
        22  front of the driver at that particular time.
        23            Those varied.  And I don't have exact
        24  records of, like, content of every single one of
        25  those that were issued or that we --
  00049:01  presentation that we put on.
        02       Q.   Do you have content of any of those
        03  presentations that were put on?
        04       A.   I'm sure that I could find some, yes.
        05  But I don't recall being asked specifically for
        06  those.
        07       Q.   But those have not been disclosed to
        08  date, true?
        09       A.   No, not to my knowledge.
        10       Q.   Did you require Volunteer Express
        11  drivers to sign in for that recurrent training
        12  process?
        13       A.   Typically, we would have them online.
        14  They sign in to do their classes, and it would
        15  create a record.  Now, the -- we also documented
        16  much of the training with, as you said, a
        17  sign-in sheet for people that were in person.
        18  And that varied depending on what division it
        19  was.
        20            The local drivers we could very
        21  easily gather into a room much easier.  And a
        22  lot of times we would do one-on-one training
        23  with the OTR guys when they came to the office.
        24       Q.   So does Volunteer Express --
        25                 MR. SKIVER:  I think we just
  00050:01  lost him again.
        02                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Going off the
        03  video record.  The time is now 9:58 a.m.

        02  as before, the following proceedings were had,
        03  to-wit:)
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on
        05  the video record.  The time is now approximately
        06  10:10 a.m.  You may proceed.
        07  BY MR. SKIVER:
        08       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, you said earlier that
        09  you create a record of the online recurrent
        10  training process meetings, true?
        11       A.   Not the process meetings,
        12  necessarily.  The online training platform
        13  itself creates a training record and produces a
        14  certificate of attendance for the classes that
        15  they have taken.
        16       Q.   And what is that online training
        17  platform?
        18       A.   It's provided through Vertical
        19  Alliance.  It's called the Infinit-I platform.
        20  At that time I believe it was the i2 platform.
        21  Some of Ms. Connelly's certificates showing that
        22  training are in the production documents.
        23       Q.   Are all of the certificates showing
        24  Defendant Connelly's certificates -- sorry.  Are
        25  all of the certificates showing Volunteer
  00052:01  Express's driver Connelly's training in the
        02  materials?
        03       A.   They should be.  If there were more,
        04  they would be in Ms. Connelly's file, and all
        05  those documents came from her file.
        06       Q.   So Defendant Volunteer Express has
        07  provided all of the documents in its possession
        08  with regards to the recurrent training processes
        09  that Connelly has attended, true?
        10       A.   Yes.  The initial training
        11  certificates are the ones in the file.  I don't
        12  believe that Ms. Connelly was here long enough
        13  to get remedial training when she had started
        14  before this accident occurred.
        15       Q.   How long does a driver have to be
        16  with Volunteer Express before they get remedial
        17  training?
        18       A.   In an OTR position, usually they
        19  would get that either quarterly or every six
        20  months.  It is possible that some was assigned
        21  that was not completed.  I don't have access to
        22  those records to check that.
        23       Q.   How does Volunteer Express ensure
        24  that its drivers are complying with the remedial
        25  training?
  00053:01       A.   We usually will run a report or --
        02  well, not usually.  We run a report.  Typically,
        03  that report may be ran quarterly, it may be ran
        04  monthly, and we would report that back to our
        05  terminal managers or supervisors for that
        06  particular division and have them talk to their
        07  drivers about getting on there and doing their
        08  training.  If they fail to do their training, we
        09  would shut them down until it's complete.
        10       Q.   And Defendant Connelly was never shut
        11  down for failing to complete training, right?
        12       A.   Not to my knowledge.
        13       Q.   And Volunteer Express's driver
        14  Connelly had been with the company for
        15  approximately eight months at the time of this
        16  crash, true?
        17       A.   True.
        18       Q.   So Connelly should have, if the
        19  training was occurring quarterly, had multiple
        20  remedial training sessions by the time of this
        21  crash, right?
        22       A.   It's possible.  She may have received
        23  a six-month training, or she may have received a
        24  one-quarter training, remedial training, the
        25  records of which I don't have in the file.  So I
  00054:01  cannot tell you if she was assigned it or if she
        02  did it at that time.
        03       Q.   And if she had done it, you would
        04  expect those records to be in the file, true?
        05       A.   Either way I would expect the records
        06  to be in the file.  I don't see where she was
        07  assigned anything during that period.
        08       Q.   So the fact that there are no records
        09  in Volunteer Express's file show that she either
        10  was not assigned any remedial training and/or
        11  did not complete any remedial training in that
        12  eight months, right?
        13       A.   That's right.
        14       Q.   And there is no indication in the
        15  file that any supervisor told Connelly that she
        16  had to complete that remedial training, correct?
        17       A.   To my knowledge, that's correct.
        18       Q.   And who would have been Connelly's
        19  supervisor?
        20       A.   I believe that supervisor changed a
        21  couple of times during Ms. Connelly's tenure.
        22  Prior to the accident, it would have been either
        23  Matt Muma or Hollie Horton, H-O-L-L-I-E.
        24       Q.   Can you spell the Muma for us,
        25  please?
  00055:01       A.   M-U-M-A, I think, if I remember
        02  correctly.
        03       Q.   Are the supervisors required to fill
        04  out any documentation to confirm that their
        05  drivers are receiving their remedial training?
        06       A.   No they would not.  The system tracks
        07  that.  They would receive notifications from us
        08  if their drivers were overdue on training.
        09       Q.   What is a systems failure?
        10       A.   What is a systems failure?  Could you
        11  clarify that?
        12       Q.   Do you know what a systems failure
        13  is?
        14       A.   I think there's multiple definitions
        15  of what a system failure could be, so I'm trying
        16  to find what context you're -- you're looking
        17  for.
        18       Q.   Well, Volunteer Express must have a
        19  system in place to ensure its drivers are
        20  familiar with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        21  Regulations, correct?
        22       A.   Correct.  That's done at orientation.
        23  Remedial training is just reinforcement.
        24       Q.   And is reinforcement important?
        25       A.   It is important, I would think.
  00056:01       Q.   Why is remedial training and
        02  reinforcement important?
        03       A.   Because people do not always retain
        04  the information that they are given at any given
        05  time.  But every driver that works for Volunteer
        06  Express is also provided with a copy of the
        07  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations so that
        08  they have them in their possession for
        09  reference.  And they also sign a document
        10  stating that they have received those
        11  regulations.
        12       Q.   What is a systems failure?
        13       A.   Again, can you clarify exactly what
        14  you are looking for by a systems failure?  Are
        15  you asking if a system failed?
        16       Q.   No.
        17       A.   Or are you asking for the technical
        18  definition of a systems failure?  Because I'm --
        19  unfortunately, I'm not a dictionary, and I can't
        20  answer directly.  I can tell you an opinion of
        21  what a systems failure could be.
        22       Q.   I'm asking what Volunteer Express's
        23  understanding of what a system failure is.
        24       A.   A systems failure would be when an
        25  objective is not reached that is based off of a
  00057:01  process, that process being, in this case, I
        02  guess, the system, because systems and
        03  processes, to us, are interchangeable.  A
        04  process is part of a system.
        05            Our objective is to have safe
        06  drivers, protect the motoring public.  And if we
        07  have achieved that goal, I don't see that as a
        08  systems failure.
        09       Q.   What is a root cause?
        10       A.   A root cause?  Again, could you
        11  specify exactly what you're looking for there?
        12  Because there's -- there's such thing as a root
        13  cause analysis.  Is that what you're seeking
        14  here?
        15       Q.   I'm asking how Volunteer Express uses
        16  the term "root cause"?
        17       A.   I don't recall that we used "root
        18  cause" as a term in any form and fashion.  We --
        19  we always looked for the source of an issue, but
        20  I can't recall that we used those specific
        21  terms.
        22       Q.   Is a root cause a source of an issue?
        23       A.   It can be, yes.
        24       Q.   What is a root cause analysis?
        25       A.   A root cause analysis, from what I've
  00058:01  seen of it, is a process that is put in place to
        02  try to get to the bottom result, the start of
        03  the source of a potential issue.
        04       Q.   So when you talk about "the source of
        05  a potential issue" through a root cause
        06  analysis, are you talking about the root cause?
        07       A.   I would think that would equate to
        08  that, yes.
        09       Q.   If one of Volunteer Express's drivers
        10  was not familiar with the Federal Motor Carrier
        11  Safety Regulations, that would be a systems
        12  failure, true?
        13       A.   I don't agree that that would be a
        14  systems failure.  That would be a driver that
        15  did not follow their training or reference their
        16  regulations.
        17            We are required to inform them of
        18  them, to train them on them, but I can't account
        19  for an individual's personal recollection of
        20  them as being a system failure.
        21       Q.   The purpose of training is to ensure
        22  that drivers remember the Federal Motor Carrier
        23  Safety Regulations, true?
        24       A.   The purpose of training is to provide
        25  information.  So no.
  00059:01       Q.   So Volunteer Express's training
        02  program is not to ensure that Volunteer Express
        03  complies with their duty under the Federal Motor
        04  Carrier Safety Regulations, to ensure its
        05  drivers comply with the Federal Motor Carrier
        06  Safety Regulations?
        07       A.   Could you clarify that, please?  The
        08  way that you are asking that?  I don't
        09  understand the question.
        10       Q.   Well, you do admit that Volunteer
        11  Express must ensure its drivers comply with the
        12  FMCSRs, right?
        13       A.   We are required to comply with FMCSA
        14  regulations, yes.
        15       Q.   And FMCSR -- or sorry.  Strike that.
        16            Volunteer Express has a system in
        17  place to ensure that its drivers comply with the
        18  FMCSRs, right?
        19       A.   We have a system in place to make
        20  sure that Volunteer Express is holding our
        21  drivers accountable to upholding the FMCSRs,
        22  yes.
        23       Q.   And if your drivers at Volunteer
        24  Express do not uphold the FMCSRs, that would be
        25  a systems failure, right?
  00060:01       A.   That would be a driver that wasn't
        02  following the policies, rules and regulations --
        03  policies of Volunteer Express, the rules and
        04  regulations of the Federal Motor Carrier
        05  system -- Safety Administration.
        06            We can't guarantee the individual
        07  actions of any one person at any given time.
        08  That would result in corrective action for that
        09  driver for failure to follow the set processes,
        10  but I don't see that as a systems failure.
        11       Q.   So Volunteer Express would always
        12  hold that driver accountable --
        13       A.   Absolutely.
        14       Q.   Please let me finish.
        15       A.   We hold drivers accountable when they
        16  violate policy or federal regulations.
        17       Q.   Please let me finish my question for
        18  the court reporter.
        19       A.   Oh, I'm sorry.
        20       Q.   We can't talk over each other.
        21            Volunteer Express always holds its
        22  drivers accountable when they violate their
        23  policies and procedures, true?
        24       A.   True.
        25       Q.   Does Volunteer Express have a safety
  00061:01  system in place to prevent crashes?
        02       A.   Could you define what you mean by
        03  "safety system"?
        04       Q.   Does Volunteer Express have any
        05  safety system in place to prevent crashes?
        06       A.   I'm trying to -- to discover if you
        07  are asking me about a -- a technical system,
        08  like a camera system or something along that
        09  lines, or are you asking about a process?  Could
        10  you clarify which one you're looking for?  Or
        11  both?  Or --
        12       Q.   Sure.  Let's talk about process
        13  first.
        14       A.   Okay.
        15       Q.   Does Volunteer Express have a process
        16  in place as a safety system to prevent crashes?
        17       A.   We have a process in place to
        18  instruct drivers on the skills that they can
        19  utilize on the road to better prevent accidents.
        20  But you can't have any system that will
        21  absolutely eliminate any accident from
        22  happening.
        23       Q.   Does Volunteer Express have a safety
        24  system in place to prevent crashes?
        25       A.   We have a safety process in place
  00062:01  that is designed to educate drivers.  And if you
        02  want to refer to that as a safety system, then I
        03  would say that that is a type of system.  I
        04  guess it's a process.
        05       Q.   So Volunteer Express does have a
        06  process in place to prevent crashes, true?
        07       A.   They have a process in place to
        08  educate drivers on the prevention of crashes,
        09  yes.
        10       Q.   Volunteer Express's process in place
        11  to prevent crashes failed in this case, true?
        12       A.   Volunteer Express doesn't have a
        13  process in place to prevent crashes.  We have a
        14  process in place to instruct drivers on
        15  techniques to prevent crashes.  And we do not
        16  believe that any process failed in this
        17  particular crash in relation to that.
        18       Q.   So Volunteer Express believes that
        19  its process to train its drivers was effective
        20  in this case?
        21       A.   Yes.
        22       Q.   Volunteer Express is familiar with
        23  the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
        24  or FMCSA, true?
        25       A.   True.
  00063:01       Q.   Volunteer Express is aware the FMCSA
        02  keeps statistics on crashes involving commercial
        03  motor vehicles, right?
        04       A.   Yes.
        05       Q.   What are the leading cause of crashes
        06  involving commercial motor vehicles?
        07                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        08  form of the question, foundation, overly broad.
        09       A.   There's -- there's multiple
        10  interpretations of the sources of crashes in
        11  multiple studies from multiple agencies from
        12  ATRI, from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        13  Administration, from the Canadian trucking
        14  association, from state trucking associations.
        15            And depending on what report, when it
        16  was received, and what the parameters were of
        17  the report that they were looking at will give
        18  different results.
        19  BY MR. SKIVER:
        20       Q.   Do you as the director of safety for
        21  Volunteer Express know the leading causes of
        22  crashes involving commercial motor vehicles?
        23       A.   Human error.
        24       Q.   What type of human error is the
        25  leading cause of crashes involving commercial
  00064:01  motor vehicles?
        02                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to
        03  foundation.
        04       A.   I can't give you -- sorry.
        05                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Go ahead,
        06  Cory.
        07       A.   I can't give you a direct answer on
        08  that because, again, the information on that
        09  changes every year.  They run a different report
        10  on it every year.  There are multiple causes
        11  that have been associated with it.
        12            Following too closely has been
        13  considered a cause.  Distracted driving has been
        14  considered a cause.  Pulling off the shoulder of
        15  the road with a disabled commercial motor
        16  vehicle has been seen as a cause.  There's all
        17  kinds of causes.  The leading cause is human
        18  error, doing one of those things or several of
        19  those things.
        20  BY MR. SKIVER:
        21       Q.   Has fatigue ever been identified as a
        22  leading cause of crashes involving commercial
        23  motor vehicles?
        24       A.   I can assume that it has.
        25       Q.   So as the director of safety, you do
  00065:01  not know?
        02       A.   I'm saying I'm sure that I have
        03  looked at a report at some point in my tenure as
        04  the director of safety and seen fatigue listed
        05  as a cause or a potential cause.
        06            Whether it was number one on the list
        07  or number three on the list, I can't tell you
        08  off the top of my head without reviewing said
        09  studies.  I don't like to guess.
        10       Q.   As a director of safety, do you know
        11  if impairment is a leading cause of crashes
        12  involving commercial motor vehicles?
        13       A.   Impairment can be a cause of crashes
        14  and typically, it's usually the other vehicle,
        15  and it's usually the four-wheeler driver that's
        16  impaired with alcohol or drugs, et cetera.
        17       Q.   Do you know if speeding is a leading
        18  cause of crashes involving commercial motor
        19  vehicles?
        20       A.   I'm sure that speeding was on one of
        21  those lists as well at some point.
        22       Q.   Volunteer Express is familiar with
        23  the National Highway Traffic Safety
        24  Administration or NHTSA, correct?
        25       A.   Yep.
  00066:01       Q.   Volunteer Express is aware that NHTSA
        02  keeps statistics on crashes, true?
        03       A.   True.
        04       Q.   Volunteer Express stays up to date on
        05  relevant safety information, right?
        06       A.   Yes.
        07       Q.   Volunteer Express stays informed on
        08  the dangers of distracted driving, correct?
        09       A.   Yes.
        10       Q.   Volunteer Express knows that
        11  approximately 5,500 people are killed each year
        12  on US roadways due to distracted driving, true?
        13       A.   I don't know if that statement is
        14  true or not.  I don't know what you're
        15  referencing that material from.
        16       Q.   So Volunteer Express does not know
        17  that 5,500 people are killed each year on US
        18  roadways due to distracted driving, correct?
        19                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        20  form, foundation, argumentative.
        21       A.   I cannot give you an answer of exact
        22  number of potential people that are in an
        23  accident from distracted driving based off of
        24  some number that I have no idea where the source
        25  came from.  I can't tell you if it's true or
  00067:01  not.
        02  BY MR. SKIVER:
        03       Q.   Would it be important for Volunteer
        04  Express to know how many people are killed each
        05  year on the roadways due to distracted driving?
        06                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        07  form of the question, foundation, argumentative.
        08       A.   I would agree that knowing what types
        09  of things happen on the roadway and those types
        10  of statistics are important.  But I cannot quote
        11  them to you off the top of my head without
        12  reviewing whatever studies or information that
        13  you're referencing.
        14  BY MR. SKIVER:
        15       Q.   So you know that knowing if something
        16  is dangerous is important to trucking companies,
        17  right?
        18       A.   Yes.
        19       Q.   Because if you know something is
        20  dangerous, it's foreseeable, and you can act to
        21  try to prevent it, right?
        22       A.   That's why we had a cell phone policy
        23  that included distracted driving.
        24       Q.   So the answer is yes?
        25       A.   Yes.  If you know something is
  00068:01  dangerous, you try to -- or you put in place a
        02  management control to affect that or to mitigate
        03  or minimize that.
        04            In other words, you do your best to
        05  put out there a policy, procedure or process
        06  that will influence the driver that you're
        07  working with to follow said procedure or process
        08  and, in turn, reduce the potential and
        09  likelihood of something dangerous from
        10  happening.  That's standard trucking 101.
        11       Q.   And Volunteer Express followed that
        12  standard trucking 101 by putting out a
        13  management control to prevent its drivers from
        14  driving distracted, true?
        15       A.   We put on a management control to
        16  instruct our drivers that it was not acceptable
        17  to do so.  But we cannot physically control
        18  whether a driver does or does not.  If we
        19  discovered it, we would take action, yes.
        20       Q.   But Volunteer Express did not put
        21  into place a management control to prevent
        22  distracted driving, true?
        23                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to
        24  form.
        25       A.   The management control we put in
  00069:01  place was designed to help prevent dangerous or,
        02  as you said, distracted driving from being
        03  undertaken.
        04  BY MR. SKIVER:
        05       Q.   According to the National Highway
        06  Traffic and Safety Administration, approximately
        07  5,500 people die each year on US roadways due to
        08  distracted driving.  Do you have any reason to
        09  dispute that?
        10       A.   The exact number, yes, I dispute it
        11  because I don't know where it comes from.  It
        12  may be much more than that.
        13       Q.   According to the National Highway
        14  Traffic and Safety Administration, an estimated
        15  448,000 people are injured each year on US
        16  roadways due to distracted driving.  Do you have
        17  any reason to dispute that?
        18       A.   Without seeing the information in
        19  front of me, I cannot confirm that information.
        20       Q.   I'm not asking if you can confirm it.
        21  My question, again, was according to the
        22  National Highway Traffic and Safety
        23  Administration, an estimated 448,000 people are
        24  injured each year on US roadways due to
        25  distracted driving.  Do you have any reason to
  00070:01  dispute that?
        02       A.   If the information was provided
        03  directly from the national highway
        04  transportation safety administration and a
        05  result of one of their studies that they have
        06  undertaken, then I would not dispute that.
        07       Q.   Is safety important to Volunteer
        08  Express?
        09       A.   Yes, absolutely.
        10       Q.   On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being
        11  most important, how important is safety to
        12  Volunteer Express?
        13       A.   Ten.
        14       Q.   Is there anything as important as
        15  safety to Volunteer Express?
        16       A.   Nope.  No, there is not.
        17       Q.   Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        18  Regulations are a baseline or a bare minimum in
        19  terms of safety, true?
        20       A.   Yes.  True.
        21       Q.   A company should strive to achieve
        22  more safety than that baseline, right?
        23       A.   True, yes.
        24                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we please pull
        25  up 02, Volunteer Express?  And I believe we're
  00071:01  going to mark this as Exhibit No. 9.
        02                 (Exhibit No. 9 marked for
        03                  identification.)
        04  BY MR. SKIVER:
        05       Q.   Can you see that document,
        06  Mr. Lorincz?
        07       A.   Yeah.  I can quote those core values
        08  without it.
        09       Q.   What is the first core value of
        10  Volunteer Express?
        11       A.   "We will be safe, professional,
        12  accountable in everything we do."
        13       Q.   What is the second core value?
        14       A.   "We will be the best value provider,
        15  run lean and efficient" --
        16       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, I'm sorry.  We have a
        17  court reporter.  Just so we're not speaking over
        18  each other, if you could just pause a second and
        19  let me finish my question.  I know you know
        20  where I'm going, but it makes her job a lot
        21  easier.
        22       A.   If you like, you can just remove them
        23  from the screen, I can tell you what they are.
        24       Q.   That's all right.  We'll have them up
        25  there.
  00072:01            Can you please tell us what the
        02  second core value is of Volunteer Express?
        03       A.   To be the best --
        04                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Wait a
        05  minute, Cory.  Wait a minute.  Ryan, what's the
        06  Bate number on this exhibit?
        07                 MR. SKIVER:  Sure.
        08                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  I don't see
        09  it on there.
        10                 MR. SKIVER:  It is 57 -- 578.
        11                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Thank you.
        12                 THE WITNESS:  Company handbook.
        13  BY MR. SKIVER:
        14       Q.   Okay.  Let me ask that question again
        15  just so it's clear.
        16            What is Volunteer Express's second
        17  core value?
        18       A.   "We will be the best value provider,
        19  run lean and efficient while maintaining the
        20  highest standards of safety, service and
        21  compliance."
        22       Q.   Does Volunteer Express maintain the
        23  highest standards of safety?
        24       A.   We outperform most people in the
        25  industry in a safety standpoint.  Yes.
  00073:01       Q.   So Volunteer Express does maintain
        02  the highest standards of safety?
        03       A.   Our results would show that, yes.
        04       Q.   Do you know what a safety management
        05  cycle is?
        06       A.   A safety management cycle?  Yes, I
        07  have heard the term before.  I don't employ any
        08  type of a graphic or a -- could you please --
        09  I'll just say no.  I'll just say no.  I can't
        10  describe exactly what it -- what it is that --
        11  I'm sure the definition that you're looking for.
        12  But I would ask that you clarify for me and then
        13  I'll tell you for sure if I do or do not.
        14                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, can you
        15  please remove Exhibit 9?
        16  BY MR. SKIVER:
        17       Q.   Do you know what the CSA is?
        18       A.   Absolutely, yes.
        19       Q.   Have you read the CSA Safety
        20  Management Cycle overview?
        21       A.   A long, long time ago, but I believe
        22  I did, yes.
        23                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, can you
        24  please pull up 03?  This will be Exhibit 10.
        25  
  00074:01                 (Exhibit No. 10 marked for
        02                  identification.)
        03  BY MR. SKIVER:
        04       Q.   Have you seen this document?
        05       A.   I believe yes, I have, a long time
        06  ago.  It was when -- when we had -- CSA 2010
        07  first came out.  I can't read it from here,
        08  but --
        09                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, can you
        10  please now pull up Exhibit --
        11       A.   Can you enlarge that for us, Ryan --
        12  BY MR. SKIVER:
        13       Q.   Sure.
        14       A.   -- so I can see the specific cycle?
        15  Because there is multiple versions of that, and
        16  I was wanting to make sure to give you a good
        17  answer to the last question.
        18       Q.   The next one I'm actually going to
        19  pull up will just be that graphic.
        20       A.   Okay.  Okay.  That works.
        21                 MR. SKIVER:  So can we pull up
        22  10 A?  Or 10.1 I think you have to do in
        23  Nebraska.
        24                 THE WITNESS:  There we go.
        25                 MR. SKIVER:  So we're going to
  00075:01  mark that as Exhibit 10.1.
        02                 (Exhibit No. 10.1 marked for
        03                  identification.)
        04  BY MR. SKIVER:
        05       Q.   Have you ever seen this graphic
        06  before of the safety management cycle?
        07       A.   I'm sure I've seen this one, and
        08  probably multiple versions of it, yes.
        09       Q.   The Safety Management Cycle starts
        10  with "Policies and Procedures," right?
        11       A.   In this example, yes.
        12       Q.   Then it goes to "Roles and
        13  Responsibilities," right?
        14       A.   In this example, yes.
        15       Q.   What does "roles and
        16  responsibilities" mean with respect to the
        17  safety management cycle?
        18       A.   Roles and responsibilities, to me,
        19  would define who is responsible for managing the
        20  safety processes and matriculating them
        21  throughout the business in order to make sure
        22  that we are upholding those policies and
        23  procedures as well as, you know, any other
        24  following actions.
        25       Q.   You said that you've seen other
  00076:01  safety management cycles.  Can you please tell
        02  us what is different about this safety
        03  management cycle from the other one that you are
        04  referencing?
        05       A.   Well, I have seen multiple of them.
        06  If you Google "safety management cycle," you'll
        07  get about a hundred different examples.  They --
        08  some of them have six steps, some of them have
        09  eight steps, some of them have ten steps.  I
        10  cannot recall off the top of my head what every
        11  single one of them was, but I can tell you that
        12  there are other versions of this.
        13       Q.   Well, do you disagree with this
        14  safety management cycle from the CSA?
        15       A.   No, not at all.
        16       Q.   After Roles and Responsibilities
        17  comes step three, "Qualification and Hiring,"
        18  right?
        19       A.   Correct.
        20       Q.   What does "qualification and hiring"
        21  mean with respect to the safety management
        22  cycle?
        23       A.   Qualification and hiring has to do
        24  with driver selection and making sure that the
        25  driver that you're hiring meets your minimum
  00077:01  hiring qualifications.
        02            In our documents here, you have a
        03  copy of the full driver minimum hiring
        04  qualifications for Volunteer Express which are,
        05  as you had asked previously, much more strict
        06  than the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        07  Regulations would require us to be.
        08       Q.   The next step in the safety
        09  management cycle is "Training and
        10  Communications," true?
        11       A.   True, in this example, yes.
        12       Q.   What does "training and
        13  communication" mean?
        14       A.   Training would be what you do with
        15  that driver once you have qualified and hired
        16  them.  Did you orientate them to the processes,
        17  procedures, and did you communicate that to the
        18  driver?
        19       Q.   Trucking companies must train their
        20  drivers, true?
        21       A.   There are certain areas that the
        22  FMCSA requires us to train in, and there are
        23  other areas that we would train in that are not
        24  required such as the Smith System.
        25       Q.   So trucking companies must train
  00078:01  their drivers, true?
        02       A.   They must train their drivers in
        03  accordance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        04  Administration, but they also have the option of
        05  additional training if they'd like.
        06       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, this is going to go a
        07  lot faster if you simply answer my yes or no
        08  questions with a yes or no.
        09            Trucking companies must train their
        10  drivers, true?
        11       A.   In accordance with the FMCSA, true.
        12       Q.   The next step is
        13  "Monitoring and Tracking," correct?
        14       A.   On this example, yes.
        15       Q.   What does "monitoring and tracking"
        16  mean?
        17       A.   Monitoring and tracking would be
        18  making sure that people are being compliant with
        19  the training or the policies and procedures as
        20  well as Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        21  Regulations, laws, rules, company policies,
        22  et cetera.
        23       Q.   Trucking companies must monitor or
        24  supervise their drivers, right?
        25       A.   Yes.
  00079:01       Q.   Does monitoring and tracking include
        02  preventability analysis?
        03       A.   It doesn't have to.  So it could, but
        04  it also could not.  It depends on the individual
        05  company.
        06       Q.   Does preventability analysis fall
        07  under monitoring and tracking?
        08       A.   If you did a preventability analysis,
        09  it would fall under monitoring and tracking.
        10       Q.   Then "Meaningful Action," right?
        11       A.   According to this example, yes.
        12       Q.   What does "meaningful action" mean?
        13       A.   It could be remedial training, it
        14  could be disqualifying your driver, or it could
        15  be corrective action.  Or it could be correcting
        16  a process deficiency.
        17       Q.   When trucking companies discover
        18  their drivers are driving dangerously, they must
        19  take meaningful action, true?
        20       A.   Yes.
        21       Q.   Volunteer Express's drivers are
        22  professional truck drivers, right?
        23       A.   Yes.
        24                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we pull up
        25  number four, sorry.  Four -- plus seven.  11.
  00080:01  Exhibit 11 now, please.  Mark this as
        02  Exhibit 11, please.
        03                 (Exhibit No. 11 marked for
        04                  identification.)
        05  BY MR. SKIVER:
        06       Q.   Does Volunteer Express believe
        07  trucking companies must train their drivers?
        08       A.   In accordance with the FMCSA, yes,
        09  they do.
        10                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, can you
        11  please mark that?
        12            Okay.  You can take that down.
        13  Thanks.
        14  BY MR. SKIVER:
        15       Q.   Why must Volunteer Express train
        16  their drivers?
        17       A.   I'm sorry.  You cut out a little bit
        18  on that.  Can you say that again, please?
        19       Q.   Sure.  Why must Volunteer Express
        20  train their drivers?
        21       A.   For two reasons.  One, to be in
        22  compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        23  Administration, the Occupational Safety Health
        24  Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous
        25  Materials Safety Administration as well as to
  00081:01  create or -- well, not create, but educate their
        02  drivers on safer behaviors to reduce risk to the
        03  motoring public and the driver.
        04       Q.   So to prevent injury and death to us
        05  all?
        06       A.   I would hope so, yes.
        07       Q.   And what can happen if trucking
        08  companies do not train their drivers?
        09                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        10  form of the question.
        11       A.   What could happen?  Or what would
        12  happen?  Was it would or could?
        13  BY MR. SKIVER:
        14       Q.   Sure.  What could happen if trucking
        15  companies do not train their drivers?
        16       A.   They might violate their --
        17                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Objection,
        18  overbroad, foundation.
        19       A.   They might violate their hours of
        20  service regulations.  They could be in an
        21  accident.  They could slip and fall in a parking
        22  lot.  That's an extremely, you know, extremely
        23  broad category.  But there is numerous things
        24  that could happen.
        25  BY MR. SKIVER:
  00082:01       Q.   If trucking companies do not train
        02  their drivers, they could cause a crash, true?
        03       A.   That is true.
        04       Q.   Proper training includes defensive
        05  driver training, right?
        06       A.   In my opinion, yes.
        07       Q.   Does Volunteer Express provide
        08  defensive driver training to its drivers?
        09       A.   We provide Smith System defensive
        10  driver training to our drivers, yes.
        11       Q.   Why does Volunteer Express provide
        12  Smith System defensive driver training to its
        13  drivers?
        14       A.   To help better protect the motoring
        15  public and our driver.
        16                 MR. SKIVER:  Will you please
        17  pull up 05, which we are going to mark as
        18  Exhibit 12, I believe.
        19                 (Exhibit No. 12 marked for
        20                  identification.)
        21  BY MR. SKIVER:
        22       Q.   Did we lose Mr. Lorincz again?
        23       A.   No, no, I'm here.
        24       Q.   Okay.  You are black.
        25       A.   I don't see it on my screen.  I was
  00083:01  waiting to see it.
        02                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Cory, you are
        03  frozen again.  Toggle your video and see.
        04                 THE WITNESS:  I have got a black
        05  screen.  It looks like it's trying to show me
        06  something, but I don't see an actual document.
        07                 MR. SKIVER:  Yeah, Bill, I'm not
        08  seeing it either.
        09                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Well, it's up
        10  there.  Good?
        11                 MR. SKIVER:  Yes, thank you.
        12  BY MR. SKIVER:
        13       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, can you see that?
        14       A.   Yes.
        15       Q.   Exhibit No. 12 is the Smith System
        16  handbook, correct?
        17       A.   Yes.
        18       Q.   And is that the Smith System that you
        19  were talking about that you use for training
        20  drivers?
        21       A.   I'm not sure what version that is,
        22  but yes.  I mean, typically they change versions
        23  every couple of years, but I'm sure it's very
        24  similar if not the same information.
        25                 MR. SKIVER:  Could you scroll
  00084:01  through that, Bill, please, just so he can take
        02  a look at it?
        03                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Just let me
        04  know when you're ready to go to the next page.
        05                 THE WITNESS:  Any time.  I've
        06  seen this book many times in many forms, so.
        07  Okay.  Keep going.  Yep.  Keep going.  Keep
        08  going.
        09                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  And that's
        10  the last page.
        11                 THE WITNESS:  Yep.  Yep.  That's
        12  a sticker on the back but, yeah.
        13  BY MR. SKIVER:
        14       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, on the next page there
        15  is a listing of common causes of collisions,
        16  true?
        17       A.   Yep.
        18       Q.   And the number one cause listed is
        19  inattention, right?
        20       A.   It says, "Many drivers do not pay
        21  enough attention to the stereo" --
        22  whoa -- "serious business of driving."
        23            In Smith System's opinion that is one
        24  of the common causes, yes.  Mine too.
        25                 MR. SKIVER:  Can you please
  00085:01  highlight that first sentence, Bill?  Not just
        02  the first line, the whole sentence, please.
        03  Thank you.  Can you please save that as 12.1, I
        04  believe.
        05                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Yes.
        06                 (Exhibit No. 12.1 marked for
        07                  identification.)
        08  BY MR. SKIVER:
        09       Q.   Let's go back to those common causes
        10  of collisions.
        11                 MR. SKIVER:  And you can take
        12  off that highlighting for us, please.
        13  BY MR. SKIVER:
        14       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, what are the other
        15  common causes of collisions that Smith System
        16  talks about?
        17       A.   Well, on this document, too much --
        18  too little attention, not enough time, not
        19  enough space, not allowing for the mistakes of
        20  others, and not enough training.  Failure to
        21  adjust to collisions, or to conditions.
        22  Attitude.  Vehicle failure.
        23       Q.   And I think you missed number nine,
        24  driver impairment.
        25       A.   Driver impairment, yes.
  00086:01       Q.   So Smith System lists those ten
        02  common causes of collisions.  Do you have any
        03  reason to dispute those?
        04       A.   No, those are common causes.
        05                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we please pull
        06  up number 06, which we're going to mark as 13.
        07                 (Exhibit No. 13 marked for
        08                  identification.)
        09  BY MR. SKIVER:
        10       Q.   Have you seen those Smith System 5
        11  Keys before?
        12       A.   Absolutely.
        13       Q.   Do agree with those Smith System's 5
        14  Keys?
        15       A.   Most of them, but one of them I do
        16  not.
        17       Q.   Which of the Smith System's 5 Keys do
        18  you not agree with as a Smith System trainer?
        19       A.   Key 2, "Get The Big Picture, 4-second
        20  minimum following distance" is not what we
        21  teach.  We teach six to eight seconds.
        22       Q.   So you believe that key 2, the
        23  4-second minimum following distance, is not
        24  enough, right?
        25       A.   Well, no, I believe that the way they
  00087:01  put it on the slide is incorrect, because they
        02  do speak of a 4-second minimum following
        03  distance, but that's when you are driving in
        04  traffic at under 40 mile an hour.
        05       Q.   Okay.  And when you're driving in
        06  traffic at 75 miles per hour, what is the
        07  minimum following distance?
        08       A.   Six to eight seconds.
        09       Q.   Does Volunteer Express train that six
        10  to eight seconds is the minimum following
        11  distance?
        12       A.   Yes.
        13       Q.   Does Volunteer Express train its
        14  drivers to add a second to that recommendation
        15  as well?
        16       A.   Yes, we do.  There was a national
        17  transportation safety highway administration
        18  report that came out called "One Second More"
        19  that we often talk about during the Smith
        20  System.  And we will talk about the fact that
        21  that one second more could potentially reduce
        22  the risk of having a crash.
        23       Q.   So Volunteer Express believes that
        24  driving seven seconds to nine seconds behind the
        25  vehicle in front of you is important to prevent
  00088:01  crashes, true?
        02       A.   True.  And additionally even more,
        03  depending on road conditions.
        04       Q.   And Volunteer Express trains its
        05  drivers to "Aim High In Steering" and "Look
        06  ahead a minimum of 15 seconds," right?
        07       A.   Yes, and we stress a minimum of 15
        08  seconds.
        09       Q.   So Volunteer Express actually
        10  instructs its drivers that they can be looking
        11  more than 15 seconds ahead while driving, right?
        12       A.   Smith System instructs you of that.
        13  That's why it's a 15-second minimum.  It allows
        14  you to properly use your different types of
        15  vision.
        16       Q.   Okay.  My question was Volunteer
        17  Express trains their drivers that that 15
        18  seconds is a minimum to be looking ahead, but
        19  they should be looking further ahead, correct?
        20       A.   Yes.  Yes.
        21       Q.   Key number four, "Leave Yourself An
        22  Out."  What does that mean?
        23       A.   "Leave yourself an out" basically
        24  means keep a space cushion around your vehicle
        25  so if you need to take evasive maneuvers you
  00089:01  can.  You can't always do it, but that's what it
        02  means.
        03       Q.   So looking ahead a minimum of 15
        04  seconds, following at a distance of, we'll say,
        05  six to nine seconds and leaving yourself an out
        06  are designed to prevent crashes, true?
        07       A.   They are designed to help a driver
        08  avoid a crash, yes.  True.
        09                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.  You can take
        10  that one down, Bill.  Thanks.
        11  BY MR. SKIVER:
        12       Q.   Does Volunteer Express -- I'm sorry.
        13  Okay.  Let me ask that again now that we've got
        14  you back on the main screen.
        15            Does Volunteer Express provide any
        16  other training to its drivers beyond the Smith
        17  System?
        18       A.   Yes.
        19       Q.   What additional training does
        20  Volunteer Express provide to its drivers?
        21       A.   Hazardous materials training, heat
        22  stress awareness training, ergonomics training.
        23  We have specific people that we teach as
        24  trainers that we offer "Train the Trainer"
        25  training, which goes through various types of
  00090:01  training as well.
        02            In our orientation training package,
        03  we cover about six to eight hours of material on
        04  everything ranging from proper use of an ELD,
        05  the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations as
        06  they relate to a truck, CSA scores, injury
        07  prevention, accident prevention.
        08       Q.   Does Volunteer Express train its
        09  drivers on how to dress?
        10       A.   On how to dress?  We have a -- we
        11  have a policy on dress that's designed
        12  specifically for our LTL drivers.
        13       Q.   And when you talk about LTL drivers,
        14  you are talking about less-than-truckload,
        15  right?
        16       A.   Correct.  Not our over-the-road
        17  drivers.  They didn't have a dress code.
        18       Q.   What type of driver was Connelly?
        19       A.   Erin Connelly?  She had a great
        20  safety record.  She met our minimum hiring
        21  qualifications when we hired her.
        22       Q.   I'm sorry.  Sorry.  Let me stop you.
        23  Yeah, I didn't mean -- I -- that was a poor
        24  question.  Between the LTL or the OTR I'm
        25  asking.
  00091:01       A.   Oh, she was an OTR driver.  She was
        02  actually a team driver and then a single --
        03  single driver OTR.
        04       Q.   Does Volunteer Express provide any
        05  retraining after its drivers violate safety
        06  rules?
        07       A.   Yes, we would.  We did.
        08       Q.   What kind of retraining?
        09       A.   We would give them remedial training
        10  related to that particular type of violation.
        11  And if it was egregious enough, we would just
        12  use corrective action and retraining.  So they
        13  would potentially receive a write-up along with
        14  training.
        15       Q.   So when you talk about corrective
        16  action, the write-up is what you are talking
        17  about?
        18       A.   Correct.
        19       Q.   And if a write-up had been done,
        20  would that be included in the driver's file?
        21       A.   Absolutely, yes.
        22       Q.   And there was no write-up with
        23  regards to Volunteer Express's driver Connelly
        24  in this case, correct?
        25       A.   In this case, related to this crash,
  00092:01  correct.  There was no write-up.
        02       Q.   Was there ever any training or
        03  retraining provided to Volunteer Express's
        04  driver Connelly after this crash?
        05       A.   No, there was not.
        06       Q.   Why not?
        07       A.   We didn't believe that -- and we
        08  still don't believe that Ms. Connelly was a
        09  proximate cause of the crash.
        10       Q.   We have got sound from somebody
        11  that's bleeding in.
        12       A.   Would you like me to answer that
        13  again?
        14       Q.   No, that's fine.  I think we got it.
        15  What does "proximate cause of the crash" mean to
        16  Volunteer Express?
        17       A.   Well, to -- to quote a previous
        18  question, I would say the root cause of the
        19  crash.  We do not believe that Ms. Connelly was
        20  the root cause of the crash.
        21                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we please pull
        22  up 08, and I think that would be marked as 13.
        23  Is that correct?
        24                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  14.
        25                 MR. SKIVER:  It's 14?  Is that
  00093:01  what you said, Jerry?
        02                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  I did.

        06       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, are you there?
        07       A.   Yes.
        08       Q.   Okay.  Sorry.  You are black on my
        09  screen.  Can you toggle off and come back,
        10  please?
        11       A.   Yeah, sure.  One second.  Am I back?
        12       Q.   There you are.  Okay.  Thank you.
        13       A.   Oh, there we go.
        14       Q.   Does Volunteer Express believe truck
        15  drivers must pay attention to the road in front
        16  of them?
        17       A.   Yes.
        18                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, can you
        19  please mark that?  You can take it down.
        20  BY MR. SKIVER:
        21       Q.   Why must truck drivers pay attention
        22  to the road in front of them?
        23       A.   Well, for starters, to see where the
        24  truck's going, but also for the potential to
        25  identify hazards ahead of them in the roadway.
  00094:01  To find an exit, if they are looking for an
        02  exit.
        03                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, I still have
        04  a blank screen up.
        05  BY MR. SKIVER:
        06       Q.   Why do truck drivers have to look for
        07  hazards in the road ahead of them?
        08       A.   Because traffic conditions change.
        09       Q.   It's foreseeable that drivers could
        10  be changing lanes in front of them, right?
        11       A.   It does happen, yes.
        12       Q.   It's foreseeable that drivers could
        13  be speeding, true?
        14       A.   True.
        15       Q.   It's foreseeable that drivers could
        16  be driving slower, right?
        17       A.   True.
        18       Q.   And professional truck drivers know
        19  this and must pay attention to those foreseeable
        20  actions to prevent crashes, right?
        21       A.   I would agree with that.  But I would
        22  also -- well, I won't add any -- too many things
        23  to it.  But --
        24       Q.   If a professional truck driver has a
        25  slower vehicle in front of them, they must slow
  00095:01  down, true?
        02       A.   Well, yeah, they would, especially if
        03  that vehicle was using their four-way flashers,
        04  which brings your attention to it more through
        05  your peripheral vision through Smith.
        06       Q.   Even if a slower vehicle is not using
        07  its four-way flashers, a professional truck
        08  driver must slow down as they approach that
        09  vehicle from behind, true?
        10       A.   Every vehicle is required to use
        11  their four-way flashers if they're driving less
        12  than 45 mile per hour on the roadway.  But a
        13  professional driver typically would slow down
        14  and/or change lanes if they saw that particular
        15  hazard.
        16            That would also depend on the type of
        17  conditions there were at the time, daylight,
        18  darkness, et cetera, whether the lights were on.
        19  There's a lot of factors that could go into
        20  that.  But if they saw them, yes, they should.
        21       Q.   Do you remember what my question was?
        22       A.   If a professional driver should slow
        23  down if they saw a slower-moving vehicle.  If
        24  they see them, yes, they should.
        25       Q.   Even if a slower-moving vehicle does
  00096:01  not have its four-way flashers on, a
        02  professional truck driver must slow down,
        03  correct?
        04                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        05  form of the question.
        06       A.   If they see them, yes.
        07  BY MR. SKIVER:
        08       Q.   A professional truck driver must be
        09  looking for hazards in front of them, right?
        10       A.   True.
        11       Q.   Every professional truck driver is
        12  taught they must pay attention, right?
        13       A.   I can't answer that everyone is.  But
        14  I would say that is the intent of most companies
        15  is to teach our people to pay attention, yes.
        16       Q.   Because it's important that
        17  professional truck drivers pay attention, right?
        18       A.   I would agree it's important that
        19  drivers pay attention.
        20       Q.   What can happen if drivers don't pay
        21  attention to what's in front of them?
        22                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        23  form of the question.  Overbroad.
        24       A.   There are too many things to list
        25  that could happen.  They could have a dog run
  00097:01  out in front of them on the roadway.  They could
        02  have a pedestrian cross in front of them.  They
        03  could have a car cut them off.  They could have
        04  a car coming off of the, you know, on-ramp into
        05  them.  They could have a disabled truck come off
        06  the shoulder in front of them.
        07            There is all kinds of things that
        08  could happen, whether they pay attention or not.
        09  But it's just such a broad category, there is
        10  too many things to list that could happen.
        11  BY MR. SKIVER:
        12       Q.   Right.  And that's why it's so
        13  important for truck drivers to pay attention to
        14  the road in front of them, right?
        15       A.   A truck driver should be paying
        16  attention to the road in front of them, yes.
        17       Q.   If a truck driver chooses not to pay
        18  attention to the road in front them, they could
        19  rear-end a vehicle, right?
        20       A.   If they chose not to pay attention,
        21  yes, that could absolutely happen.
        22       Q.   Every professional truck driver is
        23  taught that they must keep a safe distance,
        24  correct?
        25       A.   I can't say that every truck driver
  00098:01  is.  I can say that every Volunteer Express
        02  driver was.
        03       Q.   Every Volunteer Express driver is
        04  taught that they must keep a safe distance --
        05       A.   True.
        06       Q.   -- true?
        07            Paying attention and keeping a safe
        08  distance is right out of the commercial driver's
        09  license manual, right?
        10       A.   I'm not sure exactly which manual you
        11  are referring to, but I'm sure that both of
        12  those types of things are in most state manuals,
        13  yes.
        14       Q.   What should a Volunteer Express
        15  driver do if there is a slower-moving vehicle in
        16  front of them?
        17       A.   Well, if the slower vehicle hasn't
        18  suddenly moved out in front of them, they would
        19  change lanes or slow down.
        20       Q.   That wasn't my question.  My question
        21  was what should a Volunteer Express driver do if
        22  there is a slower-moving vehicle in front of
        23  them?
        24       A.   If the slower-moving vehicle is
        25  occupying the lane correctly in front of them
  00099:01  and they have time to react, they would slow
        02  down or move.
        03                 MR. SKIVER:  It looks like it's
        04  been about another hour.  Do you guys want to
        05  take another break?
        06                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Sure.  Do you
        07  want to set a time, Ryan, so we can all make
        08  sure we're here?
        09                 MR. SKIVER:  Five minutes work
        10  for you guys?  Do you need more?  Anybody need
        11  ten?  It's up to you.  I'm fine with five.
        12                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Five work for
        13  you, Cory?

        08       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, does Volunteer Express
        09  train its drivers to move over if they see a
        10  vehicle on the shoulder?
        11                 MR. SKIVER:  He's on mute.
        12  Mr. Lorincz?
        13                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Cory, you are
        14  muted.
        15                 THE WITNESS:  Sorry about that.
        16  BY MR. SKIVER:
        17       Q.   Let me ask that question again.
        18            Does Volunteer Express train its
        19  truck drivers to move over if there is a vehicle
        20  stopped on the shoulder?
        21       A.   If there is a vehicle stopped on the
        22  shoulder, yes.  We would tell our drivers that
        23  they should be changing lanes if they can.
        24  Sometimes they can't if there is a vehicle next
        25  to them, but --
  00101:01       Q.   Does Volunteer --
        02       A.   -- we do tell them that they should,
        03  yes.
        04       Q.   Does Volunteer Express train its
        05  drivers that they should move over a lane if
        06  there is a slow-moving vehicle on the shoulder?
        07       A.   A slow-moving vehicle on the
        08  shoulder?  Is that what you said?  I would
        09  consider that the same thing as being parked on
        10  the shoulder.
        11       Q.   Why does Volunteer Express train its
        12  drivers to look ahead a minimum of 15 seconds?
        13       A.   Because it allows them to get the big
        14  picture of what's going on ahead of them.  It
        15  allows them to use their peripheral vision and
        16  their central vision.
        17       Q.   Does looking ahead a minimum of 15
        18  seconds give a professional truck driver the
        19  time to react?
        20       A.   That is the intent, but it doesn't
        21  always.
        22                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to
        23  form.
        24  BY MR. SKIVER:
        25       Q.   Does leaving yourself an out give a
  00102:01  truck driver the ability to avoid a hazard?
        02       A.   Could it?  Yes.
        03       Q.   Is that the purpose of leaving
        04  yourself an out is to avoid a hazard?
        05       A.   Yes, that would be the intent.
        06  Actually, not to avoid a hazard.  It's to allow
        07  you to maneuver in the event of a hazard.
        08       Q.   If a driver is looking ahead a
        09  minimum of 15 seconds and sees a hazard, that
        10  would give them plenty of time to slow down,
        11  true?
        12       A.   I would say that depends.
        13       Q.   When is there an instance when
        14  looking ahead 15 seconds, at a minimum, and
        15  seeing a hazard does not allow a truck driver to
        16  slow down?
        17       A.   Well, a truck travels, at 70 mile an
        18  hour, approximately 105 feet per second.  So
        19  three seconds, in itself, would be a football
        20  field of travel time ahead of you.  If you are
        21  going around a curve, up a hill, over a bridge,
        22  there are numerous times where that 15 seconds
        23  can be impeded by either some vehicle in front
        24  of you that's a large vehicle, or an obstacle.
        25  Even the sun could be something that could make
  00103:01  it to where you can't see 15 seconds ahead.
        02            So our intent is always to look 15
        03  seconds ahead to help us prevent the possibility
        04  of an accident by being able to make a maneuver
        05  or slow down.  But it's all subjective to the
        06  environment that you are driving in.
        07       Q.   So let's assume that the environment
        08  that you are driving on is a straight road where
        09  you can see a minimum of 15 seconds ahead of
        10  you.
        11            Does that view for 15 seconds at a
        12  minimum allow a truck driver to slow down to
        13  avoid a hazard?
        14       A.   Potentially, yes.
        15       Q.   And you listed off a bunch of
        16  potential situations that require a driver to
        17  pay attention to what's in front of him.  And
        18  that's because there is lots of different
        19  hazards that a truck driver may encounter, true?
        20       A.   True.
        21       Q.   There could be a car broken down in
        22  the lane of travel ahead of them, right?
        23       A.   True.
        24       Q.   There could be a school bus full of
        25  children driving slower than the speed limit,
  00104:01  right?
        02       A.   True.  But they would have their
        03  hazard lights on.
        04       Q.   Assuming the school bus does not have
        05  its hazards lights on, does that mean a truck
        06  driver would be allowed to crash into the back
        07  of them?
        08       A.   No.  I'm saying it's more likely if
        09  they didn't have their hazard lights on.
        10       Q.   Okay.  Well, assuming a school bus
        11  does not have its hazard lights on and it's
        12  driving slower than the speed limit, does that
        13  permit a truck driver to crash into the back of
        14  them?
        15       A.   No, not at all.
        16       Q.   Why not?
        17       A.   Why would it not?  Well, because you
        18  are supposed to be looking far enough ahead of
        19  you to hopefully avoid a hazard, but it depends
        20  on what that school bus is doing.  You said
        21  lower than the speed limit.  It could be doing
        22  35 mile an hour.  It could be doing 50.  Could
        23  be on the highway doing 70.  But it depends on
        24  the speed of the vehicles of whether they could
        25  avoid it.  But the intent would be that, yeah,
  00105:01  we're hoping we can.  That's the intent.
        02       Q.   So let's assume a school bus is going
        03  35 miles an hour --
        04       A.   Okay.
        05       Q.   -- on the highway.  It doesn't have
        06  its hazards on.
        07       A.   You say 35?
        08       Q.   Yes.
        09       A.   Okay.
        10       Q.   Let's assume a school bus is driving
        11  on the highway at 35 miles an hour.  Does the
        12  truck coming up behind them have a right to
        13  crash into the back of them?
        14       A.   Well, of course they don't have a
        15  right to, but is it more likely to?  Yes,
        16  because the school bus is in violation of the
        17  road laws, number one, and they're placing
        18  theirself and their students in jeopardy by
        19  driving that slow.  But it doesn't give them a
        20  right, no.
        21       Q.   Because if a driver is paying
        22  attention and looking a minimum of 15 seconds
        23  down a straight roadway, they should see that
        24  hazard in front of them, true?
        25       A.   If there's no other vehicles blocking
  00106:01  their view, there's no other obstacles blocking
        02  their view, yeah.  I would think they'd have a
        03  chance, at least, to avoid it.
        04            But you're asking me to tell you what
        05  the reaction time is going to be of any driver
        06  at any given time.  I can't give you an exact on
        07  that for anybody.  I mean, they do studies on
        08  it.  That's why the NTSB did the "one second
        09  more" scenario.
        10            But we hope, and that is the intent,
        11  is that if you are looking 15 seconds down the
        12  road, we hope that you can actually identify a
        13  hazard and get out of the way, as long as you
        14  don't suddenly have a hazard pop out of nowhere,
        15  which does happen from time to time.
        16            If you're driving in the right lane
        17  and there is a car broke down in the right lane
        18  and there is a car to your left, you may not be
        19  able to get over if that car pulls out in front
        20  of you from the shoulder.
        21       Q.   Are you finished?
        22       A.   Yep.
        23       Q.   Okay.  So if you are looking 15
        24  seconds, at a minimum, ahead, based on your math
        25  earlier, that would be at least five football
  00107:01  field lengths, true?
        02       A.   Well, we tell people to look about
        03  a -- about a tenth of a mile -- well, three
        04  tenths of a mile.  Every tenth of a mile is
        05  about 5 seconds.
        06       Q.   That wasn't my question.  Please
        07  listen to my questions and answer my questions.
        08            Earlier you stated that three seconds
        09  is about the equivalent of a football field, so
        10  if you are looking a minimum of 15 seconds down
        11  the road, that would be the equivalent of about
        12  five football fields, true?
        13       A.   Well, we're talking about two
        14  different things.  I'm talking about the speed
        15  of the vehicle, and you're talking about the
        16  distance you're looking ahead.  We use two
        17  different things to measure those.
        18                 MR. SKIVER:  Objection,
        19  nonresponsive, move to strike.
        20            Can you please read back my question
        21  to the witness.
        22         (Reporter read the record as requested.)
        23       A.   The vehicle would be traveling five
        24  football fields, yes.
        25  BY MR. SKIVER:
  00108:01       Q.   So you would have that time of
        02  driving the length of five football fields to
        03  react to a hazard that was a minimum of 15
        04  seconds down the road, right?
        05       A.   Well, the 15 seconds that somebody is
        06  looking is not -- I'm not staring out my
        07  windshield all the time 15 seconds ahead of me.
        08  I'm also required by the Smith System to check
        09  my mirrors every three to eight seconds and pay
        10  attention to my space cushion around me.  So the
        11  driver is not constantly staring 15 seconds
        12  ahead.  They may not have glanced forward for
        13  eight seconds, so maybe they have six now.
        14       Q.   So it's acceptable to Volunteer
        15  Express for a driver not to glance forward for
        16  eight seconds at any given time?
        17       A.   No, I'm stating that the driver is
        18  required to do things while they are driving
        19  like look at their speedometer, glancing at it
        20  to make sure they are doing the proper speed,
        21  checking their left mirror, checking their right
        22  mirror, looking out the windshield.  They're not
        23  100 percent of the time focused 15 seconds ahead
        24  of them.  It's impossible or you'd crash into
        25  everything.
  00109:01       Q.   Does Volunteer Express train its
        02  drivers that they must look ahead a minimum of
        03  15 seconds?
        04       A.   We train them that the best practice
        05  is for them to look ahead 15 seconds down the
        06  roadway or more, preferably more.
        07       Q.   And that's so your drivers can see
        08  hazards ahead of them, true?
        09       A.   That's so we can reduce the
        10  likelihood of them having a hazard interrupt
        11  their path of travel, yes.
        12       Q.   And to leave themself an out so they
        13  can avoid that hazard in front of them, correct?
        14       A.   When possible, yes.
        15                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we -- Bill, can
        16  we please pull up 09, which I believe we'll mark
        17  as Exhibit 15.
        18                 (Exhibit No. 15 marked for
        19                  identification.)
        20  BY MR. SKIVER:
        21       Q.   Does Volunteer Express believe
        22  distracted drivers are safe drivers?
        23       A.   Of course not, no.
        24                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, can you
        25  please mark Exhibit 15?
  00110:01            Okay.  You can take that down.  Thank
        02  you.
        03  BY MR. SKIVER:
        04       Q.   Does Volunteer Express believe
        05  fatigued drivers are safe drivers?
        06       A.   You say fatigued drivers?
        07                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        08  form, vague.
        09       A.   If you are fatigued, you should not
        10  be driving.
        11  BY MR. SKIVER:
        12       Q.   Does Volunteer Express believe
        13  fatigued drivers are safe drivers?
        14       A.   No.  Fatigued driving, you
        15  shouldn't -- if you're fatigued, you should not
        16  be driving.
        17       Q.   Did Volunteer Express provide any
        18  company manuals or handbooks to Volunteer
        19  Express's driver Connelly?
        20       A.   I'm sure that we have given them the
        21  employee handbook as well as numerous policies,
        22  much if not all of -- which I would assume all
        23  of -- is in this production document.
        24       Q.   What specific manual or handbooks did
        25  Volunteer Express provide to Connelly?
  00111:01       A.   They would have received the company
        02  handbook, which you referenced earlier, with
        03  core values.  They would have also received
        04  numerous policies.  Let me take a glance here.
        05            They would have gotten the attendance
        06  policy, cell phone use policy, 180-day retention
        07  policy, the regulated employee combined policy
        08  acknowledgment, driver coercion policy, driver
        09  uniform guidelines, drug and alcohol policy,
        10  equipment modification policy, hazardous
        11  material and tanker policy --
        12         (Reporter clarification.)
        13                 THE WITNESS:  Would it be easier
        14  to just reference the Bates numbers?
        15                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  No.
        16       A.   So where was I at?  Drug and alcohol
        17  policy, equipment modification policy, hazardous
        18  material and tanker endorsement policy, incident
        19  investigation plan, inspection receipt
        20  submission and tracking process for DOT
        21  violations, personal appearance and personal
        22  conveyance policies, pet policies, Qualcomm
        23  website access for drivers, safety policies for
        24  the use of a yard hostler and for drivers on the
        25  yard, safety vest use, shoe policy, vehicle
  00112:01  inspection and reporting policy, weight and
        02  dimension policy.  She would have also received
        03  the cell phone policy, which is on another page
        04  here.
        05  BY MR. SKIVER:
        06       Q.   Would Volunteer Express have provided
        07  the employee handbook, Bates-labeled 574 through
        08  611, to Connelly?
        09       A.   Yes.
        10       Q.   Would Volunteer Express have provided
        11  the shareholder manual, Bates-labeled 612
        12  through 636, to Connelly?
        13       A.   I believe both of those are the same
        14  document in different formats.
        15       Q.   Are there any other driver's manuals
        16  or handbooks besides those two?
        17       A.   No.
        18       Q.   Does Volunteer Express require its
        19  drivers to follow the handbook?
        20       A.   Yes.
        21       Q.   What is the purpose of Volunteer
        22  Express's handbook?
        23       A.   The purpose of the handbook is to
        24  inform the driver about company processes,
        25  health care, retirement plan, days off,
  00113:01  corrective action process.  There's also
        02  notations in there related to internet usage.
        03  There's notations in there related to them being
        04  required to be a safe driver.  It covers a lot
        05  of different areas.  But the intent is to inform
        06  the driver of many of our processes and
        07  procedures for their information, so they have
        08  access to it.
        09       Q.   Is one of the purposes of Volunteer
        10  Express's handbook to share the process for
        11  safety with its drivers?
        12       A.   I believe there is a safety section
        13  associated with it.  But it is not a complete
        14  safety section.  That's why we have the
        15  orientation.  That's why we have the in-person
        16  orientation.  That's why we have the separate
        17  policies that we have them sign off on as well.
        18       Q.   Does Volunteer Express provide its
        19  employees a separate safety manual?
        20       A.   No.
        21       Q.   Are Volunteer Express's policies and
        22  procedures rules that your employees must
        23  follow?
        24       A.   Yes.
        25       Q.   Trucking companies can require that
  00114:01  their drivers follow their safety rules, right?
        02       A.   Yes.  As long as they're more strict
        03  than the FMCSA.  You cannot be less strict.
        04       Q.   Trucking companies can require their
        05  drivers to follow more strict safety rules than
        06  the FMCSRs, true?
        07       A.   Yes, true.
        08       Q.   If trucking companies discover
        09  conduct that is dangerous, they can put safety
        10  rules in place to prevent that dangerous
        11  conduct, correct?
        12       A.   Correct.
        13       Q.   The failure to follow safety rules
        14  endangers lives, true?
        15       A.   True.  I would think so.
        16       Q.   You would agree that any risk of
        17  injury or death is unreasonable if reasonable
        18  crash-prevention measures could reduce the risk
        19  or eliminate it, true?
        20       A.   Can you state that one more time
        21  because -- let me get a little closer.  The
        22  fan's blowing in my ear.
        23       Q.   Sure.  You agree that any risk of
        24  injury or death is unreasonable if reasonable
        25  crash-prevention measures could reduce the risk
  00115:01  or eliminate it, true?
        02       A.   No, I don't agree with that.
        03       Q.   So you believe that the risk of
        04  injury or death is reasonable, no matter what?
        05       A.   No, I don't agree with that either.
        06       Q.   Can you please explain why you do not
        07  agree that any risk of injury or death is
        08  unreasonable if reasonable crash-prevention
        09  measures could reduce the risk or eliminate it?
        10       A.   Because regardless of the
        11  crash-prevention measures that you put in place,
        12  there is always going to be a risk.
        13       Q.   Do you believe that all drivers of
        14  commercial motor vehicles must have the
        15  knowledge and skills necessary to operate their
        16  truck safely?
        17       A.   Yes.
        18       Q.   What is a visual search?
        19       A.   A visual search?  Could you specify a
        20  little bit more what you're looking for?
        21       Q.   As a professional truck driver, what
        22  does the "term visual" search mean with respect
        23  to driving safely?
        24       A.   I have never used that term in
        25  context of driving safely.  We use other
  00116:01  terminology.  That's why I was asking for
        02  specification.
        03       Q.   What other terminology do you use
        04  instead of "visual search" for a professional
        05  truck driver?
        06       A.   It depends on the context of what
        07  they're doing a visual search on.  Are we
        08  visually searching the vehicle for defects?  Are
        09  we trying to, you know, look down the roadway?
        10  Because we consider looking down the roadway to
        11  be scanning, not a visual search.  The Smith
        12  System teaches you that you use your central
        13  vision to scan the roadway.  Is that what you're
        14  referring to?
        15       Q.   We can use your definition.
        16       A.   Okay.  Thank you.
        17       Q.   When you're following the Smith
        18  System and using your central vision to scan the
        19  roadway, what are you scanning for?
        20       A.   Everything.  Any types of hazards.
        21  You're -- you're scanning not just the roadway
        22  ahead of you, you are scanning your mirrors as
        23  well.  You're required, under the Smith System,
        24  to keep your eyes moving at all times, whether
        25  it's in your mirrors or out the front
  00117:01  windshield.
        02       Q.   So part of what you are scanning for,
        03  under the Smith System, is hazards, true?
        04       A.   Yes, true.
        05       Q.   Does Volunteer Express believe that a
        06  driver must pay attention to the vehicles around
        07  them when driving?
        08       A.   Yes.
        09       Q.   Why?
        10       A.   To be a safer driver.
        11       Q.   To avoid a collision?
        12       A.   Potentially.
        13       Q.   A professional truck driver should
        14  know what is going on around their vehicle while
        15  they are driving, true?
        16       A.   In my opinion, I would think they
        17  should, yes.
        18       Q.   Earlier you mentioned that they
        19  should be scanning their rearview mirrors, so
        20  they should be able to see cars approaching in
        21  the lane next to them, true?
        22       A.   Well, they would use their side-view
        23  mirrors, but semantics.  But the intent is to
        24  create a 360-degree circle of awareness around
        25  your vehicle.  That's what the Smith System
  00118:01  teaches.
        02       Q.   So a professional truck driver
        03  following the Smith System would keep a
        04  360-degree circle of awareness around their
        05  truck while they are driving, right?
        06       A.   That's the intent, yes.
        07       Q.   So they would know if it was safe to
        08  move into the lane next to them, correct?
        09       A.   We would assume so, yes.
        10       Q.   Or to slow their vehicle instead of
        11  changing lanes, right?
        12       A.   Potentially.
        13       Q.   Paying attention to what's in front
        14  of a professional driver is just common sense,
        15  right?
        16       A.   I would think so, yeah.
        17       Q.   Is that safety rule of paying
        18  attention to what's in front of a professional
        19  driver important?
        20       A.   Well, it's not necessarily a safety
        21  rule, but it is a darn good best practice.  And
        22  it is very important, yes.
        23       Q.   So you don't think paying attention
        24  to what's in front of your truck is a safety
        25  rule?
  00119:01       A.   It's not written as a safety rule.
        02  It's semantics.  Is it important?  Absolutely
        03  important.  Do we consider it to be the
        04  guidelines we instruct and teach people?  Yes.
        05  Can I write somebody up if they are not, you
        06  know, 100 percent paying attention and nothing
        07  happens?  No.  Can I if an accident happens?
        08  Potentially, yes.
        09            So is it a safety rule?  It's
        10  semantics on that aspect of it.  But is it
        11  important?  Absolutely.
        12       Q.   So Volunteer Express does not
        13  consider paying attention to what's in front of
        14  a professional truck driver to be a safety rule,
        15  true?
        16       A.   We teach our drivers to use the Smith
        17  System to look down the roadway and see what's
        18  in front of their vehicle and to create a
        19  360-degree circle of awareness around their
        20  vehicle.  We do not write them up over it.  It's
        21  not a written safety rule, so to say.
        22                 MR. SKIVER:  Objection,
        23  nonresponsive, move to strike.

        25       Q.   Volunteer Express does not consider
  00120:01  paying attention to what's in front of a
        02  professional truck driver a safety rule, true?
        03       A.   We consider it to be important and
        04  most people would classify it as a safety rule,
        05  but it is not a written safety rule at Volunteer
        06  Express.
        07       Q.   So Volunteer Express does not

        10  true?
        11                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
        12  form of the question, asked and answered,
        13  argumentative, misstates the witness's
        14  testimony.
        15       A.   Volunteer Express expects our drivers
        16  to create a 360-degree circle of awareness
        17  around their vehicle while they are driving down
        18  the road.  It is not a written safety rule for
        19  them to follow, but it is absolutely important.
        20  BY MR. SKIVER:
        21       Q.   So Volunteer Express's drivers are
        22  not required to pay attention to the road in
        23  front of them?
        24       A.   I didn't say that.
        25                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the

        04       Q.   So Volunteer Express's drivers must
        05  pay attention to the road in front of them,
        06  right?
        07       A.   We expect all drivers to create a
        08  360-degree circle of awareness around their
        09  vehicle, which includes paying attention to what
        10  is in front of them, is what we teach them
        11  during the Smith System training.
        12            It is not a written rule that we are
        13  going to write someone up specifically because
        14  of inattention, because there is no way to
        15  quantify that a driver was or was not paying
        16  attention at any particular --

        18  going to talk for another 20 minutes.

        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on
        05  the record at 11:43 a.m.  You may proceed again,
        06  Mr. Skiver.
        07                 MR. SKIVER:  Thank you.  Can you
        08  please spotlight Mr. Lorincz for everyone?
        09  BY MR. SKIVER:
        10       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, what is distracted
        11  driving?
        12       A.   Well, there is numerous definitions
        13  of that, but I would assume that it is anything
        14  that -- anything that distracts you from doing
        15  your job, cell phones, videos, could even be a
        16  cell phone call on a headset or through a --
        17  what do you call it? -- the -- the hands-free
        18  stuff, you know.  Any of that could be
        19  potentially distracting.
        20            So distracted driving to me is being
        21  distracted while you are driving.  It could be
        22  eating food.
        23       Q.   Does not paying attention to the
        24  traffic around you endanger others?
        25       A.   I would say that it could, yeah.
  00123:01  Yes.
        02       Q.   Is it a truck driver job to be aware
        03  at all times while driving?
        04       A.   It is a truck driver's job to pay
        05  attention, I guess that would be be aware, of
        06  what's going around them.  They have to pay
        07  attention to what they are doing, yes, be aware,
        08  I guess.
        09       Q.   So truck drivers must pay attention
        10  at all times, true?
        11       A.   They should pay attention at all
        12  times, yes.
        13       Q.   Truck drivers must keep their truck
        14  under control at all times, correct?
        15       A.   Yes.
        16       Q.   Truck drivers must look where they
        17  are going, right?
        18       A.   Yes.
        19       Q.   A safe truck driver must have his
        20  truck under control at all times, right?
        21       A.   I would think all truck drivers must,
        22  but you are safer when you're doing so, yes.
        23       Q.   And a safe truck driver must look far
        24  enough down the road to identify hazards in time
        25  to stop, correct?
  00124:01       A.   They should, yes.
        02       Q.   Is it true that the space a truck
        03  driver is driving into is the most important
        04  space for them to be aware of?
        05       A.   Yeah, I would -- I would say yes to
        06  that answer.  I think it's all important.  But
        07  the most important, I would say, is where you're
        08  headed.
        09       Q.   Truck drivers must be alert at all
        10  times, right?
        11       A.   True.
        12       Q.   Being alert means taking the time to
        13  locate hazards in your area and having a plan to
        14  avoid them, true?
        15       A.   That's an interpretation.  I would
        16  state that being alert means that you are paying
        17  attention to your surroundings.  Being alert
        18  means that you are -- you have your hands on the
        19  steering wheel, you know how fast you're going,
        20  you know that you're in your lane properly, so
        21  you're paying attention to all of your
        22  surroundings.
        23       Q.   Being alert means taking the time to
        24  locate hazards in your area and having a plan to
        25  avoid them, true?
  00125:01       A.   You can be alert and still not
        02  recognize a hazard.
        03       Q.   If you are a being alert, you should
        04  recognize a hazard.  That's part of the point of
        05  being alert, right?
        06       A.   You are much more likely to, yes.
        07       Q.   Truck drivers must keep an eye out
        08  for obstructions and plan to avoid them?
        09       A.   Yes.
        10       Q.   Truck drivers must be aware at all
        11  times while driving?
        12       A.   Yeah, they should be, yes.
        13       Q.   Truck drivers must observe traffic at
        14  all times while driving?
        15       A.   Yes.
        16       Q.   The primary job of a truck driver is
        17  safety?
        18       A.   True.
        19       Q.   A reasonably careful truck driver
        20  avoids unnecessary risks?
        21       A.   True.
        22       Q.   A reasonably careful driver must
        23  avoid distractions while driving?
        24       A.   True.
        25       Q.   Distracted driving is preventable?
  00126:01       A.   True.
        02       Q.   A reasonably careful trucking company
        03  must train its drivers to prevent distracted
        04  driving?
        05       A.   I agree with that.  Through a policy
        06  or formal training, yes.
        07       Q.   A reasonably careful trucking company
        08  must train its drivers to avoid distracted
        09  driving?
        10       A.   True.
        11       Q.   A reasonable -- excuse me.  A
        12  reasonably careful trucking company must
        13  supervise its drivers to prevent distracted
        14  driving?
        15       A.   Did you say "must supervise their
        16  drivers"?
        17       Q.   Yeah, let me restate that for you.
        18       A.   Please.
        19       Q.   A reasonably careful trucking company
        20  must supervise or monitor its drivers to prevent
        21  distracted driving?
        22       A.   We must monitor our drivers, but that
        23  doesn't necessarily prevent distracted driving,
        24  because we didn't have inward-facing cameras in
        25  the vehicles to be able to do so.
  00127:01       Q.   So inward-facing cameras in trucks is
        02  a way to monitor drivers to prevent distracted
        03  driving?
        04       A.   Oh, absolutely.
        05       Q.   And Volunteer Express did not have
        06  driver-facing cameras to monitor its drivers to
        07  prevent distracted driving?
        08       A.   No, we did not.
        09       Q.   Safety for others on the road is job
        10  number one?
        11       A.   Agree.  True.
        12                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we please pull
        13  up number 10, which will be marked as
        14  Exhibit 16.
        15                 (Exhibit No. 16 marked for
        16                  identification.)
        17                 MR. SKIVER:  I have got a black
        18  screen for Mr. Lorincz again.
        19            Can you please toggle on and off?
        20                 THE WITNESS:  It says
        21  "ConnectWise Automate system settings.  To
        22  update your system" -- that's something -- no, I
        23  don't want it to update, no.  Hang on one
        24  second.  I'm trying to toggle it here.  Am I
        25  back?
  00128:01                 MR. SKIVER:  No.  There we go.
        02                 THE WITNESS:  There we go.
        03  BY MR. SKIVER:
        04       Q.   Do you see the Exhibit 16, "CMV
        05  Driving Tips - Driver Distraction" from the
        06  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, in
        07  front of you?
        08       A.   Yes.
        09       Q.   Do you see that highlighted portion?
        10       A.   I'm sorry.  Give me one second here.
        11  I want to read the whole thing here to
        12  understand what I'm looking at.
        13            Okay.  Yes, I see the highlighted
        14  section.
        15       Q.   So in that FMCSA CMV driving tips for
        16  driver distraction, what does that highlighted
        17  section say?
        18       A.   It says that "A 2009 study found that
        19  71 percent of large-truck crashes occurred when
        20  the truck driver was doing something besides
        21  driving the truck."
        22       Q.   In this case Volunteer Express's
        23  driver Connelly was doing something besides
        24  driving the truck at the time of the crash,
        25  true?
  00129:01       A.   Oh, that's a question.  Okay.  They
        02  were driving the truck.  I understand that she
        03  glanced at the GPS.
        04       Q.   So Volunteer Express's driver
        05  Connelly was looking at the GPS prior to the
        06  crash, true?
        07       A.   My understanding is that she glanced
        08  at the GPS, yes.
        09                 MR. SKIVER:  You can take that
        10  down.  Thank you, Bill.
        11            Bill, can we please put up I believe
        12  it's 26.  And this is going to be Exhibit
        13  No. 17?  Wait, that's not the right one.
        14            Sorry.  You can take that one down.
        15  I have got my numbering off here.
        16            It's going to be 18.
        17                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Say that one
        18  more time.
        19                 MR. SKIVER:  Sure.  18.
        20                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  18.  Okay.
        21  And we're using -- number 26 is going to be
        22  Exhibit 18.  Here we go.
        23                 MR. SKIVER:  We're on 17, I
        24  believe, for 18.
        25                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Oh.  Oh, oh,
  00130:01  oh, oh, oh.
        02                 MR. SKIVER:  Yeah.  Sorry.  That
        03  was the incorrect one.
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Item number
        05  17.
        06                 MR. SKIVER:  No.  Item number
        07  18.  Yes, this is going to be Exhibit 17, for
        08  the court reporter.
        09                 (Exhibit No. 17 marked for
        10                  identification.)
        11  BY MR. SKIVER:
        12       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, distracted driving is
        13  dangerous driving?
        14       A.   I would agree with that.
        15                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to
        16  form of the question or the exhibit, I should
        17  say.  It's overly broad and lacks any context.
        18  BY MR. SKIVER:
        19       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, distracted driving is
        20  dangerous driving?
        21       A.   I would agree that distracted driving
        22  is dangerous driving.  But there are many types
        23  of distractions that potentially don't affect
        24  the driver's ability to drive safely.
        25                 MR. SKIVER:  Bill, can you
  00131:01  please mark "yes," and you can take that one
        02  down.  And can you please bring Mr. Lorincz
        03  back?
        04  BY MR. SKIVER:
        05       Q.   Does Volunteer Express believe that
        06  distracted driving can be safe driving?
        07       A.   I said some forms of distractions
        08  doesn't affect the driver's ability to drive
        09  safely.
        10       Q.   What forms of distraction don't
        11  affect the driver's ability to drive safely?
        12       A.   Well, typically speaking, most
        13  vehicles come equipped now from the factory with
        14  a GPS system installed.  And the FMCSA allows
        15  for placement of your GPS device within the
        16  lower four inches of the windshield, which to me
        17  would give the ability for someone to briefly
        18  glance at their GPS to help, just as the same as
        19  they would glance at their speedometer to see
        20  what speed they were looking at, to make sure
        21  they were traveling down.
        22            The audible that comes out of most
        23  GPSs I would not necessarily see as being
        24  distracting but more additive to the process of
        25  safe driving because it gives you a heads-up of
  00132:01  when you're going to make your next lane change
        02  or when you might have to get off the highway or
        03  when you might have a turn coming up.
        04       Q.   So Volunteer Express does not believe
        05  that a GPS system is distracting?
        06       A.   I believe that a properly used GPS
        07  system is not distracting to a driver if they
        08  are using it specifically as a momentary
        09  reference.
        10       Q.   So Volunteer Express believes that a
        11  GPS system, if properly used, is not
        12  distracting?
        13       A.   True.
        14       Q.   Is looking at a GPS system
        15  distracting?
        16       A.   Glancing at it to see where you are
        17  at on the roadway?  I would say that it can
        18  be -- can -- sorry.  How to best word this here.
        19            Yeah, I would say it's not
        20  necessarily a distraction for you to be able to
        21  look at your GPS in a brief interval to get your
        22  bearings.  It's part of your circle of
        23  awareness.
        24       Q.   So Volunteer Express believes that
        25  the GPS system is part of its driver's circle of
  00133:01  awareness?
        02       A.   I believe that a GPS system can be a
        03  part of a driver's circle of awareness if
        04  properly used.
        05       Q.   Does the Smith System teach its
        06  drivers that a GPS system is part of a circle of
        07  awareness?
        08       A.   No.  But just like with additional
        09  policies, we have the ability to be additive to
        10  the process in our training as well by telling a
        11  driver that it is okay to use a GPS properly to
        12  help them navigate the roadways.  We would much
        13  rather have them do that than trying to open a
        14  map driving down the highway as people used to
        15  do.
        16       Q.   Because taking your eyes off the
        17  roadway to look at a map can be distracting,
        18  right?
        19       A.   It would take a long time to find
        20  your bearings on the map and where you are at
        21  and would require you to remove your eyes from
        22  the roadway for quite a while, as to where
        23  glancing at a GPS should only take a moment to
        24  do, just like looking in your mirrors.
        25       Q.   So when you say "a moment," what do
  00134:01  you mean?
        02       A.   Could be a second, could be two
        03  seconds.
        04       Q.   Would you expect --
        05       A.   A moment is subjective.
        06       Q.   And you're the one who used the term
        07  "moment."  That's why I'm asking you what it
        08  means to Volunteer Express.
        09       A.   I would say most people could look at
        10  their GPS within about a second, second and a
        11  half of looking at it, and get their bearings of
        12  where they're at on that line, whether it shows
        13  an arrow that they turn right.
        14       Q.   So looking at a GPS system for longer
        15  than a second, second and a half, would be
        16  distracting?
        17       A.   I can't tell you.  I haven't
        18  scientifically studied whether it is or is not
        19  based on one second or two seconds.  That's the
        20  same as saying looking in my mirror for one
        21  second is distracting.
        22       Q.   Well, you are a trainer for Smith
        23  System and the director of safety for Volunteer
        24  Express, correct?
        25       A.   Correct.
  00135:01       Q.   And you said that you've gone above
        02  and beyond the Smith System training to tell
        03  your drivers that looking at a GPS system can be
        04  part of your circle of awareness, right?
        05       A.   Well, I didn't necessarily class it
        06  and above and beyond.  I said that the -- we can
        07  use it.  We can be additive to the process.
        08            So for me, in my opinion, and as
        09  Volunteer Express's director of safety, I would
        10  tell my drivers that I would much prefer as a
        11  best practice that they are using a GPS system
        12  compared to a hand-held map when trying to
        13  navigate the US highway system or the public
        14  roadways.
        15            And I would expect that they would
        16  have it in -- the ability to glance at it, just
        17  like they would at their mirror or their
        18  speedometer or anything else they would do to
        19  create a circle of awareness of around their
        20  vehicle.
        21       Q.   The safest way to use a GPS system
        22  would be to turn on the audio so that a driver
        23  does not have to look at it, correct?
        24       A.   I would think it would be safer than
        25  being able to look at it, yes, but I don't know
  00136:01  that all GPS systems have audio.  I don't know
        02  what type of GPS system was used in this case.
        03       Q.   You do not -- Volunteer Express did
        04  not preserve the GPS system that was used in
        05  this truck at the time of this crash, true?
        06       A.   Volunteer Express did not provide a
        07  GPS system to be used in the truck.  I'm
        08  assuming that would have been on a -- some form
        09  of a GPS device that belonged to Driver
        10  Connelly.
        11       Q.   So Driver Connelly made a
        12  modification to the Volunteer Express truck and
        13  added a GPS system?
        14       A.   Incorrect.  But Driver Connelly used
        15  their own GPS system, which is not a
        16  modification of the truck.
        17       Q.   Did Volunteer Express preserve the
        18  GPS system that Defendant Connelly was using at
        19  the time of this crash?
        20       A.   To my knowledge, no.
        21       Q.   Why is distracted driving so
        22  dangerous?
        23       A.   Well, distracted driving is dangerous
        24  because it potentially removes your eyes from
        25  the roadway.  But it could also be that you're
  00137:01  listening to a song on the radio or an audio
        02  book that gets you not thinking about the
        03  roadway.  So it depends on the type of
        04  distraction, but there's -- there's many dangers
        05  to it.
        06            In Smith System we teach that
        07  somebody that is just stuck in their head
        08  thinking, right, they -- they're not using their
        09  central vision to look down the roadway.  They
        10  are using only their peripheral vision.  And for
        11  somebody that stares at something too long, they
        12  can get tunnel vision to where they don't use
        13  their peripheral vision.
        14            So distractions in general, it
        15  depends on the type, the -- of stimulus
        16  distraction that's being received.  But they're
        17  all potentially dangerous because there is
        18  different results that could happen from any of
        19  them.
        20       Q.   And the different types of
        21  distraction are the visual distraction, true?
        22       A.   Visual distraction is one of them,
        23  yes.
        24       Q.   Cognitive distraction, right?
        25       A.   Cognitive would be another one, yes.
  00138:01       Q.   And the third type would be some type
        02  of combination of the two?
        03       A.   Potentially, yes.
        04       Q.   Are there any other types of
        05  distraction?
        06       A.   I don't know.  I'm sure there is
        07  probably more definitions than that.  But those
        08  are ones that I'm familiar with when it applies
        09  to driving a truck.
        10       Q.   Please tell us all that Volunteer
        11  Express knows about this crash.
        12       A.   All that we know about this crash.
        13  Okay.
        14            From my recollection, our driver was
        15  headed down the highway approximately 70 mile an
        16  hour, 65 mile an hour, somewhere in that range,
        17  and the defendant or the plaintiff, I guess,
        18  Mr. Cajiao, pulled a disabled commercial motor
        19  vehicle over into the lane in front of them.
        20            Mr. -- or Ms. Connelly had another
        21  vehicle traveling directly to her left
        22  preventing her from making a lane change.  It
        23  was stated that she glanced at her GPS and
        24  looked up and that truck was coming over into
        25  her lane.
  00139:01            It is also our understanding that
        02  Mr. Cajiao had had a issue, a breakdown on the
        03  side of the road, and was attempting to get to
        04  the next exit to get something repaired on their
        05  vehicle.
        06            We were informed at one point that
        07  there was an ELD system or an AOBRD system in
        08  Mr. Cajiao's truck, which we later found out was
        09  not the case.
        10            Let's see here.  As far as the crash
        11  going on, the understanding is, from the witness
        12  statements and the -- the photographic evidence
        13  and the damage amounts between the two vehicles,
        14  that the speed differential would indicate that
        15  the driver was driving in Cajiao's truck at a
        16  much lower rate of speed than they initially
        17  told us, which was, if I remember correctly,
        18  stated 60 or 65 was how fast their driver was
        19  going.
        20            Our witness -- or the witness to the
        21  accident stated that they were going much slower
        22  than that, maybe in the area of 25 or 30 mile an
        23  hour, with no hazard lights on going down the
        24  road.
        25            As far as the crash itself, it's our
  00140:01  understanding that Mr. Cajiao was taken to the
        02  hospital and treated for their injuries, and
        03  later we returned Ms. Connelly back to Nashville
        04  and had the truck and trailer brought back to
        05  Nashville as well.
        06       Q.   Was Defendant Connelly injured?
        07       A.   What's that?
        08       Q.   Was Defendant Connelly injured?
        09       A.   No.
        10       Q.   You indicated that evidence showed
        11  the speed differential determination was that
        12  Mr. Cajiao -- Cajiao, excuse me -- Mr. Cajiao
        13  was driving at a much lower speed.  Is that
        14  right?
        15       A.   Well, typically, when I look at an
        16  accident, and I'm looking at the evidence for
        17  the accident, you can look at the amount of
        18  damage on each piece of equipment and it will
        19  give you a good idea of the speed difference
        20  between them.
        21            Two objects traveling at 65 and 70
        22  mile an hour making contact would have very
        23  minimal damage to the back of the truck and to
        24  the front of the truck for the truck hitting
        25  them.  When a vehicle is going much slower or
  00141:01  even potentially stationary, the damage will be
        02  greater on both.
        03            Having seen several types of crashes
        04  in my tenure as a safety professional, I took a
        05  pretty decent look at it and I could tell right
        06  away that the 65-mile-an-hour story that I was
        07  being told from Arga transportation was not
        08  correct.  There would not be nearly as much
        09  damage as there was.  And that was collaborated
        10  by the witness statements that were received.
        11       Q.   Are you a crash reconstructionist?
        12       A.   I am not.
        13       Q.   Have you seen any reports from any
        14  crash reconstructionists?
        15       A.   I have not.
        16       Q.   Do you know how long -- or actually,
        17  strike that.
        18            Do you know if there were any skid
        19  marks prior to the crash?
        20       A.   Prior to the crash?  No, I have no
        21  way of knowing that.  Neither does anyone else.
        22       Q.   There is no way to determine if there
        23  were skid marks prior to the crash?
        24       A.   Maybe there is some scientific method
        25  that they can do to test how old a skid mark
  00142:01  was.  I don't know that any of that was done.
        02       Q.   How far into the lane of travel was
        03  Mr. Cajiao's truck when it was impacted?
        04       A.   I don't know for sure exactly how far
        05  they were in the lane, but the skid marks
        06  indicated they were coming into the lane with
        07  locked axles on the rear trailer.
        08       Q.   I thought you just indicated that
        09  there were no skid marks.
        10       A.   You said, "skid marks prior to the
        11  crash."
        12       Q.   So you're saying there were skid
        13  marks after the crash?
        14       A.   This is a part of -- the cause of the
        15  crash.  I consider it to be the same thing.
        16       Q.   Okay.  So you indicated that there
        17  are skid marks after the impact, true?
        18       A.   There are -- there are skid marks
        19  that show or that appear to show that the
        20  trailer was drug onto the roadway.  I guess, in
        21  answering your previous question again, yes,
        22  from the photographic evidence showing that, I
        23  would say that those happened just prior to the
        24  crash.
        25       Q.   Was Mr. Cajiao's truck completely
  00143:01  within the lane of travel when he was rammed
        02  from behind?
        03       A.   I don't know for sure.  I didn't get
        04  out there and measure it.
        05       Q.   Did you see any indication that
        06  Mr. Cajiao's truck was not fully in the lane of
        07  travel when he was rammed from behind?
        08       A.   Again, I couldn't tell you.  All I
        09  saw was the resting place of the vehicles.  And
        10  that could change subjective to the crash
        11  impact.
        12       Q.   So you did not go to the scene of the
        13  crash?
        14       A.   I did not.
        15       Q.   Did anyone from Volunteer Express go
        16  to the scene of the crash?
        17       A.   Erin Connelly was on the scene of the
        18  crash.  We did not have a terminal in that area
        19  to send a manager out to.
        20       Q.   So no one besides Defendant Connelly
        21  went to the scene of this crash from Volunteer
        22  Express, true?
        23       A.   From our company, no.  That's true.
        24  From our company.
        25       Q.   Did anyone else go to the scene of
  00144:01  the crash from Volunteer Express besides their
        02  driver Connelly?
        03       A.   We had an adjuster that went out to
        04  the crash from the -- to take photographs and do
        05  what adjusters do.
        06       Q.   Anyone else besides the adjuster?
        07       A.   I'm sure that there were police and
        08  firefighters but nobody else that's associated
        09  with us.
        10       Q.   When did the adjuster go out to the
        11  scene of the crash?
        12       A.   I believe the adjuster was on scene
        13  shortly after the crash happened.  I don't
        14  recall the exact time that they showed up on the
        15  scene of the accident.  But they were notified
        16  immediately.
        17       Q.   So do you believe it was within the
        18  first 24 to 48 hours that the adjuster for
        19  Volunteer Express went to the scene of the
        20  crash?
        21       A.   Oh, I believe so, yes.
        22       Q.   So you knew that litigation was
        23  likely, true?
        24       A.   Any time there is a crash, in the
        25  environment that we live in right now, we
  00145:01  prepare for litigation.
        02       Q.   How many crashes have Volunteer
        03  Express's drivers been involved in?
        04       A.   I don't have an exact number to give
        05  you on that right at the moment.  You know, off
        06  the top of my head -- and I don't have a --
        07  any -- I don't have any way to actually run a
        08  report on that anymore.  I don't work for
        09  Volunteer Express.  And I don't know that they
        10  have the -- even have the system.  It's a very
        11  antiquated system.
        12       Q.   What insurance coverage did Volunteer
        13  Express have on November 2nd, 2017?
        14       A.   Our insurance was through AIG.
        15       Q.   Do you know what the policy limits
        16  were?
        17       A.   I believe we had a million dollars,
        18  and I think our deductible was 100,000 maybe.
        19       Q.   Do you know if there were any
        20  umbrella policies or other policies in addition
        21  to that underlying one million?
        22       A.   I don't know for sure if there were
        23  additional policy limits above that.
        24       Q.   How does Volunteer Express pay its
        25  drivers?
  00146:01       A.   It varies depending on the job
        02  position.
        03       Q.   For over-the-road truck drivers, how
        04  does Volunteer Express pay its drivers?
        05       A.   Cents per mile.
        06                 MR. SKIVER:  Do you guys want to
        07  take a quick break?  I think it's been maybe an
        08  hour.  It's kind of tough with different breaks.
        09                 THE WITNESS:  I'm good either
        10  way.
        11                 MR. SKIVER:  Let's give the
        12  court reporter a break.
        13                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Going
        14  to go off the record now at 12:12 p.m.  We're
        15  going off of the record.
        16         (At 12:12 p.m. - Recess)
        17  
        18  
        19  
        20  
        21  
        22  
        23  
        24  
        25  
  00147:01         (At 12:23 p.m., with all parties present
        02  as before, the following proceedings were had,
        03  to-wit:)
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We are back
        05  on the record at 12:23 p.m.  You may proceed.
        06  BY MR. SKIVER:
        07       Q.   Thank you.  Mr. Lorincz, I noticed
        08  that you made some notes over the break on your
        09  notepad.
        10       A.   Yeah, I made a couple of notes when I
        11  got back.  There were -- yeah, they weren't
        12  necessarily related to this case.
        13       Q.   What did you write down?
        14                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Don't answer
        15  that.
        16  BY MR. SKIVER:
        17       Q.   Are those for your reference?
        18       A.   Not related to the case, no.  They
        19  are more just me telling myself to slow down a
        20  little bit and listen to your questions, if you
        21  really want to know.
        22       Q.   Okay.  So they are for your reference
        23  in answering questions?
        24       A.   I'm a tactile learner, so I remember
        25  things when I jot them down.
  00148:01       Q.   So you wrote that down so that you
        02  could reference it in giving your testimony
        03  going forward, right?
        04       A.   No, I wrote that so that I breathe
        05  and don't cut you off.
        06       Q.   Okay.  So can you please show us what
        07  you wrote down?
        08                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  No.
        09                 MR. SKIVER:  What's the
        10  privilege there?
        11                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Yes.
        12                 MR. SKIVER:  What is it?
        13                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Mine.
        14                 MR. SKIVER:  It's your privilege
        15  for what?
        16                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Attorney-
        17  client.
        18                 MR. SKIVER:  If he wrote it down
        19  for his reference, then it's no longer
        20  attorney-client privilege.
        21                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  I disagree.
        22                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.  Well, we can
        23  take it to the judge and we can deal with that
        24  later if you're -- so are you instructing him
        25  not to provide the information that he put down
  00149:01  as a reference for himself?
        02                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  I am.
        03  BY MR. SKIVER:
        04       Q.   Okay.  And Mr. Lorincz, are you
        05  following your attorney's instruction?
        06       A.   Yes.
        07                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.  Can we
        08  please pull up number 21.  There we go, okay.
        09  And I think we marked this -- are we up to
        10  number 18, Miss Court Reporter?
        11                 THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes.
        12                 MR. SKIVER:  So if we could mark
        13  this as Exhibit 18, please.  And the Bates
        14  number at the bottom is Volunteer 000270 and
        15  271.
        16                 (Exhibit No. 18 marked for
        17                  identification.)
        18  BY MR. SKIVER:
        19       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, do you recognize this
        20  document?
        21       A.   Yes, I created both of them.
        22       Q.   Is this Volunteer Express's incident
        23  investigation form?
        24       A.   That is what we used for incident
        25  investigations, yes.
  00150:01       Q.   And are these kept in a driver's
        02  file?
        03       A.   Typically, they are, yes.
        04       Q.   And is that in the normal course of
        05  business?
        06       A.   That is the normal course of
        07  business.  I will state that I don't -- I don't
        08  recall the exact date that this form itself was
        09  created by me, and believe that it's possible
        10  this specific one might have been created after
        11  this particular accident.  I'm not sure.
        12            It would have been part of a larger
        13  group.  I can look up the date on that policy
        14  and it would tell me, which would be the --
        15  let's see here -- HR process remove changes.
        16            Okay.  The docket you are looking at
        17  is -- okay, that -- yes, that would have
        18  typically been in place, yes.  That was created
        19  prior.
        20                 MR. SKIVER:  And Bill, if you
        21  could zoom into that top box, please.  No, the
        22  one above that.  The gray one.
        23  BY MR. SKIVER:
        24       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, what does that say?
        25       A.   It says, "This Incident Investigation
  00151:01  Form is to be used to investigate all accidents,
        02  incidents and injuries" --
        03                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Slow down.
        04                 THE WITNESS:  Sorry.
        05  BY MR. SKIVER:
        06       Q.   Can you please start over.  The court
        07  reporter has to take down everything.
        08       A.   Yes, I keep forgetting that we have
        09  somebody typing stuff out here too.
        10       Q.   Okay.  So what does that form say at
        11  the top?
        12       A.   "This Incident Investigation Form is
        13  to be used to investigate all accidents,
        14  incidents and injuries, situations having
        15  potential for injury, or in which damage or harm
        16  to the environment can occur.  Complete within
        17  36 hours and forward to Safety and Risk."
        18                 MR. SKIVER:  And then we'll save
        19  that portion of it, I guess, as 18.1, please.
        20                 (Exhibit No. 18.1 marked for
        21                  identification.)
        22                 MR. SKIVER:  You can take down
        23  the incident investigation form, that
        24  Exhibit 18, please.  Thank you.
        25                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Just to
  00152:01  reiterate, what we're saving is 18.1, this
        02  blowup?
        03                 MR. SKIVER:  Yes.
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Thank you.
        05  BY MR. SKIVER:
        06       Q.   Did Volunteer Express investigate the
        07  November 2nd, 2017, crash we're here about
        08  today?
        09       A.   I investigated it, yes.
        10       Q.   Why did you investigate this crash?
        11       A.   Because we investigate every crash.
        12  We always do so to prepare for litigation
        13  because in the environment we operate in,
        14  trucking, you get sued whether it's your fault
        15  or not.
        16       Q.   Did you fill out this incident
        17  investigation form for this crash?
        18       A.   I did not.
        19       Q.   Did anyone fill out this incident
        20  investigation form for this crash?
        21       A.   Not to my knowledge.
        22       Q.   Why not?
        23       A.   Because it's reported -- this
        24  information is provided from the manager and the
        25  driver to the safety department, i.e. me.  And
  00153:01  since I was handling this directly myself, I
        02  didn't fill out the form to hand to myself.
        03       Q.   So you don't keep track of records
        04  that you are going to be using in the future?
        05       A.   Well, I took notes at that time.  But
        06  we had an adjuster that also helped to
        07  investigate as well.
        08       Q.   Where are those notes that you took
        09  at the time of your investigation?
        10       A.   Well, when I departed working for
        11  Volunteer Express, they were left there at the
        12  corporate headquarters for Volunteer.  And I
        13  have requested those, but they were unable to
        14  provide them to me.
        15            I typically would leave them in a
        16  notebook and I had a -- right on the top of them
        17  what the notebook was for.
        18       Q.   And you left that notebook so other
        19  people at Volunteer Express would know what your
        20  investigation determined?
        21       A.   In the event that there was a suit,
        22  that they would have access to it, yes.
        23       Q.   And it's your understanding that that
        24  was not preserved for this litigation?
        25       A.   That is my understanding.
  00154:01       Q.   What were the results of your
        02  investigation into this crash?
        03       A.   My investigation determined that
        04  Mr. Cajiao -- Cajiao?  I'm not sure how to
        05  pronounce his name -- the plaintiff in this
        06  case, pulled off the side of the roadway in
        07  front of my driver, and my driver was not able
        08  to change lanes because of a vehicle next to
        09  them.
        10       Q.   What were the most probable root
        11  causes of this crash?
        12       A.   Suddenly coming onto the road with a
        13  disabled commercial motor vehicle in front of
        14  our driver.
        15       Q.   Was that the only root cause of this
        16  crash?
        17       A.   That was the cause that I determined
        18  it to be, yes.
        19       Q.   Was there anything that Volunteer
        20  Express's driver Connelly did that was a cause
        21  of this crash?
        22       A.   Not to my knowledge.
        23       Q.   Did this crash involve a serious
        24  injury?
        25       A.   It's my understanding that the
  00155:01  plaintiff in this case, Mr. Cajiao, was injured.
        02       Q.   And this crash involved a vehicle
        03  accident?
        04       A.   Two commercial motor vehicles
        05  colliding, yes.
        06       Q.   With equipment damage, right?
        07       A.   Yes.
        08       Q.   Did Defendant Connelly have to fill
        09  out this form within the first 36 hours of the
        10  crash?
        11       A.   No, because Defendant Connelly was on
        12  the phone with me talking about it and I was
        13  taking notes.
        14       Q.   Were alcohol and drug tests performed
        15  on Volunteer Express's driver Connelly
        16  postcrash?
        17       A.   No.
        18       Q.   Why not?
        19       A.   FMCSA regulations require a drug and
        20  alcohol test to be performed on a driver only in
        21  a couple of different scenarios.  One of those
        22  scenarios is a crash that involves a vehicle
        23  being towed in which your driver was cited.  The
        24  second one is if somebody is injured and your
        25  driver is cited.  And the third one is if there
  00156:01  is a fatality.
        02            Our driver was not cited and there
        03  was no fatality.  Therefore we did not drug test
        04  defendant -- sorry, Defendant Connelly.
        05       Q.   Does Volunteer Express have its own
        06  policy regarding postcrash alcohol and drug
        07  testing?
        08       A.   We used to.
        09       Q.   And would that prior policy have
        10  required that Volunteer Express drug and alcohol
        11  test its driver Connelly?
        12       A.   In the past they would drug test
        13  people for a -- small collisions using a non-DOT
        14  drug test.
        15       Q.   So the answer is yes, Volunteer
        16  Express's policies before would have required
        17  that they drug and alcohol test their driver
        18  Connelly, true?
        19       A.   I'm not sure what time that policy
        20  changed, but at one point in time there was a
        21  policy in place for that.
        22       Q.   At some point Volunteer Express
        23  decided to get rid of that policy, right?
        24       A.   That would be my understanding.
        25       Q.   Does Volunteer Express care if its
  00157:01  drivers cause crashes?
        02       A.   Absolutely.
        03       Q.   Does Volunteer Express want to learn
        04  from prior crashes?
        05       A.   Absolutely.
        06       Q.   So what does Volunteer Express do to
        07  learn from prior crashes?
        08       A.   We look at the crash information
        09  that's presented to us and see if there is any
        10  remediation steps that we can take to prevent
        11  the same or similar type of crash from occurring
        12  in the future.
        13       Q.   Did Volunteer Express learn anything
        14  from this crash?
        15       A.   We did not put into place any
        16  remedial changes or any policy changes related
        17  to this crash.
        18       Q.   Volunteer Express did not put in any
        19  remedial changes based on what happened in this
        20  crash because you believe that your driver did
        21  nothing wrong, right?
        22       A.   We believe the proximate cause of the
        23  crash was the plaintiff in this case.
        24       Q.   The reason that Volunteer Express did
        25  not take any remedial measures is because it's
  00158:01  your position that your driver did nothing
        02  wrong?
        03       A.   Our driver was not in violation of
        04  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations or
        05  company policy at the time of the crash.
        06       Q.   It's a simple yes or no question.
        07  Did Volunteer Express take any remedial actions
        08  based on what your driver did in this crash?
        09       A.   No.
        10       Q.   Volunteer Express chose not to do a
        11  preventability analysis of this crash, true?
        12                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to
        13  form of the question.
        14       A.   We don't use the term "preventability
        15  analysis."  We don't look at things in
        16  preventable and non-preventable like most
        17  companies.  There is a lot of companies that
        18  don't look at it that way.
        19            We look at whether or not we can
        20  learn something from it and whether or not we
        21  can do remediation.  And in this case there was
        22  no cause to remediate.
        23  BY MR. SKIVER:
        24       Q.   Has Volunteer Express ever done a
        25  preventability analysis?
  00159:01       A.   I'm not aware if they did or did not
        02  prior to my tenure.  I don't recall that they
        03  did.
        04       Q.   Does Volunteer Express care if its
        05  crashes are preventable?
        06       A.   The term "preventable" is not
        07  something that we would use on a day-to-day
        08  basis.  We didn't look at crashes, again,
        09  whether they were preventable or
        10  non-preventable.  It was whether or not we could
        11  learn something from them.  Do we care if we
        12  could learn something from the crash?  Either
        13  way, we'd like to learn something from the
        14  crash.
        15            But when we're looking at it, we are
        16  looking to see what level of involvement our
        17  driver had, what level of involvement the other
        18  driver had in the crash.
        19       Q.   Do you believe the American Trucking
        20  Association is a reliable source of information?
        21       A.   They can be.
        22       Q.   According to the American Trucking
        23  Association, the concepts of preventability and
        24  defensive driving are essential to the operation
        25  of a fleet safety program, true?
  00160:01       A.   I don't know if I would agree with
        02  that or not.  I'm not sure what context it's
        03  referring to.  Is it -- sorry.
        04       Q.   That's all right.  As the director of
        05  safety for Volunteer Express, you don't know
        06  that the concepts of preventability and
        07  defensive driving are essential to the operation
        08  of a fleet safety program?
        09       A.   Defensive driving is absolutely
        10  essential to having a safe free -- safe fleet,
        11  but the concept of whether or not to call
        12  something preventable or non-preventable I think
        13  is irrelevant.
        14            Do we want to prevent crashes?
        15  Absolutely.  That's what remedial actions are
        16  for.  That's what training in advance is for.
        17       Q.   According to the American Trucking
        18  Association, the concept of preventability is
        19  based on the premise that the professional truck
        20  driver is expected to meet a higher standard of
        21  performance than the average motorist, right?
        22       A.   I do agree.  A driver is held to a
        23  higher standard of performance than an average
        24  motorist.
        25       Q.   What is a preventable collision?
  00161:01       A.   I think that's subjective to opinion.
        02  I don't typically use preventable or
        03  non-preventable in relation to a collision.
        04       Q.   The National Safety Council has
        05  developed this definition:  A preventable
        06  collision is one in which the driver failed to
        07  do everything that they reasonably could have
        08  done to avoid it.
        09            Do you agree with that?
        10       A.   I can agree with their definition.
        11       Q.   Volunteer Express did not do a
        12  preventability analysis regarding this crash,
        13  correct?
        14                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object.
        15       A.   We investigated the crash.
        16                 MR. SKIVER:  I'm sorry, is
        17  somebody else speaking?
        18                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  I did.  I
        19  have an objection.
        20                 MR. SKIVER:  Is it form or
        21  foundation?
        22                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Form.
        23  BY MR. SKIVER:
        24       Q.   Volunteer Express did not do a
        25  preventability analysis regarding this crash,
  00162:01  true?
        02                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Same
        03  objection.
        04       A.   Volunteer Express investigated this
        05  crash, yes.
        06  BY MR. SKIVER:
        07       Q.   But it did not do a preventability
        08  analysis, correct?
        09       A.   We don't use the term "preventability
        10  analysis."  We did an incident investigation, we
        11  just did not use the document that we have
        12  provided.
        13       Q.   The purpose of a preventability
        14  analysis is to determine the root cause of a
        15  crash to prevent future crashes, right?
        16       A.   I don't -- is that -- I don't know
        17  where you're reading that from.  Is that from
        18  the American Trucking Association?
        19       Q.   I'm just asking you.
        20       A.   Can you restate the question again,
        21  please?
        22       Q.   Sure.  The purpose of a
        23  preventability analysis is to determine the root
        24  causes of a crash to prevent future crashes,
        25  right?
  00163:01       A.   I don't personally use what --
        02  preventability analysis to determine that.  We
        03  do investigate crashes and we use that
        04  information to help prevent future crashes.
        05       Q.   So that root cause that's listed as
        06  something that you have to determine on your
        07  incident investigation form, is to be able to
        08  prevent crashes in the future, right?
        09       A.   It's to be able to develop training
        10  or systems or processes that may help to
        11  eliminate or reduce the likelihood of a crash
        12  occurring in the future.
        13       Q.   With regard to this crash, were you
        14  the only one who investigated it or was there
        15  actually a crash review board involved?
        16       A.   That would be me.
        17       Q.   So you are the crash review board?
        18       A.   What we did at Volunteer Express was
        19  I did the investigation and I sat down with the
        20  president of the company and the vice president
        21  of the company and told them my findings.  And
        22  they agreed with our findings.
        23       Q.   When Volunteer Express or you did
        24  that analysis of what caused the crash, all of
        25  Volunteer Express's driver Connelly's phone
  00164:01  records were still in existence, true?
        02       A.   Potentially.
        03       Q.   Did you do that investigation and
        04  determination right after the crash?
        05       A.   It took a couple of months.
        06       Q.   Did you review Defendant Connelly's
        07  phone records?
        08       A.   I did not.
        09       Q.   When you did that analysis of what
        10  caused the crash, what did you do to get the
        11  documents to show that Connelly was not texting?
        12       A.   I didn't ask for the phone records
        13  from Defendant Connelly.
        14       Q.   So Volunteer Express did not ask for
        15  the phone records, whether it be for calls or
        16  texting, from Connelly when it was investigating
        17  this crash, true?
        18       A.   It was not a legal proceeding and,
        19  frankly, I didn't have the right to demand them
        20  from her.
        21       Q.   That wasn't my question.  My question
        22  was --
        23                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  We
        24  need to go off the video at 12:42 p.m.
        25         (At 12:42 p.m. - Recess)
  00165:01         (At 12:43 p.m., with all parties present
        02  as before, the following proceedings were had,
        03  to-wit:)
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on
        05  the video record 12:43 p.m.  You may proceed.
        06  BY MR. SKIVER:
        07       Q.   Volunteer Express did not get
        08  Defendant Connelly's phone records, whether that
        09  be for calls or texts, when it investigated this
        10  crash?
        11       A.   No, we did not.
        12       Q.   So beyond asking Volunteer Express's
        13  driver Connelly what happened, you did no
        14  further investigation into what he was doing or
        15  she was doing?
        16       A.   We looked at the telematics data for
        17  the truck, which tells a lot of information
        18  typically.  We would have also looked at the ELD
        19  logs of the truck.  I looked at those too.
        20       Q.   And that's the evidence that
        21  Defendant Volunteer Express did not preserve,
        22  true?
        23       A.   I'm under the understanding that's
        24  all in the same folder with my notebooks.
        25       Q.   And that's all gone?
  00166:01       A.   I -- I'm under the understanding it
        02  is.  They were not able to provide it to me when
        03  I requested it.
        04       Q.   Volunteer Express's driver Connelly
        05  could lose his job if he was texting and
        06  driving, right?
        07       A.   Absolutely.
        08       Q.   So it would benefit Volunteer
        09  Express's driver Connelly to lie and say that he
        10  was not texting at the time of the crash?
        11       A.   I'm sure that it could benefit
        12  someone to lie and say they weren't texting.
        13       Q.   What did you do to make sure that
        14  Volunteer Express's driver Connelly wasn't on
        15  the computer watching a video?
        16       A.   There is no way for me to legally
        17  obtain that information from the driver unless
        18  they volunteer it to me.
        19       Q.   All of the internet and computer data
        20  in Volunteer Express's trucks is considered part
        21  of your information that you are entitled to,
        22  right?
        23       A.   If it's owned by us, yes.
        24       Q.   Well, any use of the internet,
        25  according to your policies and procedures, says
  00167:01  that everything that goes over that, it's your
        02  internet, is the property of Volunteer Express,
        03  true?
        04       A.   True.  But we don't provide internet
        05  in the trucks to drivers.
        06       Q.   You know that being on a cell phone,
        07  if you are talking or texting, is illegal while
        08  driving a tractor-trailer, right?
        09       A.   It's not illegal.  There are
        10  regulations specifically related to it.  You are
        11  required to use a one-button touch system per
        12  the FMCSA regulations in order to talk on a cell
        13  phone.
        14       Q.   So typing in and texting while
        15  driving is illegal while driving a
        16  tractor-trailer?
        17       A.   Of texting, but I thought you said
        18  talking.
        19       Q.   I included both.
        20       A.   Gotcha.  Yeah, texting would be.
        21       Q.   And actually talking with your
        22  handset is illegal while driving a
        23  tractor-trailer, right?
        24       A.   In that form and fashion, yes, that
        25  would be illegal as well.
  00168:01       Q.   Was this crash of November 2nd, 2017,
        02  preventable?
        03       A.   In my opinion, and -- well, I would
        04  ask you to specify, if you would.  Preventable
        05  on whose part?
        06       Q.   Preventable in any way.  Do you
        07  believe that the crash of November two
        08  thousand -- sorry.
        09            Preventable in any way.  Do you
        10  believe that the crash of November 2nd, 2017,
        11  was preventable in any way?
        12       A.   Yeah, I believe this crash would have
        13  never happened if Defendant Cajiao would not
        14  have pulled onto the roadway with a disabled
        15  commercial motor vehicle.
        16       Q.   This crash was preventable if
        17  Volunteer Express's driver was paying attention,
        18  true?
        19       A.   I don't agree with that.
        20       Q.   This crash was preventable if
        21  Volunteer Express's driver was keeping a safe
        22  distance, right?
        23       A.   I don't necessarily agree with that
        24  either.
        25       Q.   This crash was preventable if
  00169:01  Volunteer Express's driver had control of the
        02  truck?
        03       A.   I don't agree with that statement the
        04  way it's worded either.
        05       Q.   Did Volunteer Express fire or
        06  terminate their driver Connelly after this
        07  crash?
        08       A.   No.
        09       Q.   Why not?
        10       A.   Because the driver was not the
        11  proximate cause of the crash.  It was Defendant
        12  Cajiao.
        13       Q.   Did Volunteer Express provide any
        14  retraining to Connelly because of this crash?
        15       A.   Again, this was previously asked in
        16  another form.  We did not offer any remediation
        17  or remedial training to Ms. Connelly because we
        18  did not see that Mrs. Connelly had done anything
        19  in violation of FMCSA regulations or company
        20  policy to contribute to the crash.
        21       Q.   Volunteer Express is familiar with
        22  the USDOT Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        23  Administration's "Preventable Accident Manual,"
        24  true?
        25       A.   I may or may not have seen it my
  00170:01  years in safety.  I probably have.
        02                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we please pull
        03  up 11, and I believe it's going to be marked as
        04  Exhibit 19.
        05                 (Exhibit No. 19 marked for
        06                  identification.)
        07                 MR. SKIVER:  Mr. Lorincz, can
        08  you please toggle?
        09                 THE WITNESS:  Oh, there is no
        10  button for me to toggle to see it.  Oh, talking
        11  about my camera?
        12                 MR. SKIVER:  Yeah.
        13                 THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Hang on one
        14  second.  Did that work?
        15                 MR. SKIVER:  I'm still not
        16  seeing you.  There we go.
        17  BY MR. SKIVER:
        18       Q.   Okay.  Are you able to see that?
        19       A.   Yes, I am.
        20       Q.   Okay.  Have you seen this Exhibit 19
        21  before?
        22       A.   Can you show me more of it, please?
        23       Q.   Sure.
        24                 MR. SKIVER:  Can you please
        25  scroll for him?
  00171:01       A.   Keep scrolling.
        02                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  That's the
        03  last page.
        04       A.   Oh, I gotcha.  I don't believe that I
        05  ever have saw that manual or seen that manual.
        06                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.  Can we
        07  please go to the third page.
        08  BY MR. SKIVER:
        09       Q.   The FMCSA's "Preventable Accident
        10  Manual" has a table of accident situations and
        11  countermeasures.  And this page in front of you
        12  has an accident situation listed as rear-ending.
        13  Do you see that?
        14       A.   Oh, okay.  On the left, yes.  There.
        15  Thank you.  I guess I don't have my glasses.
        16  Yes, I see rear-ending.
        17       Q.   So rear-ending just like the crash in
        18  this case?
        19       A.   I see rear-ending.
        20       Q.   And then the next part that --
        21                 MR. SKIVER:  And let's mark that
        22  as 19.1, please.
        23                 (Exhibit No. 19.1 marked for
        24                  identification.)
        25  BY MR. SKIVER:
  00172:01       Q.   The next box to the right talks about
        02  potential causes for a rear-end crash.  What are
        03  the potential causes for rear-ending another
        04  vehicle?
        05       A.   In this example they're giving,
        06  following too closely, aggressive or reckless
        07  driving, inattention or drowsiness, illness or
        08  fatigue.  But none of those potential causes
        09  were in effect in this crash.
        10       Q.   So let me restate that because I
        11  believe you missed a portion of that, and so
        12  it's clear for the court reporter.  The USDOT
        13  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
        14  Preventable Accident Manual lists potential
        15  causes for a rear-ending accident situation as
        16  following too closely, aggressive or reckless
        17  driving attitude, inattention or drowsiness, and
        18  illness or fatigue, right?
        19       A.   There are numerous other causes that
        20  could be in place.  Those are the ones they have
        21  listed in this manual, yes.
        22       Q.   For countermeasures for a rear-ending
        23  crash, they indicate defensive driving, illness
        24  and fatigue, using and changing lanes, and brake
        25  performance, correct?
  00173:01       A.   They list those there, but I'm not
        02  sure what countermeasures they're referring to.
        03  Are those sections of the manual?
        04                 MR. SKIVER:  If we could please
        05  turn to the next page.
        06  BY MR. SKIVER:
        07       Q.   Okay.  Here is a section of the
        08  manual for defensive driving.  For the objective
        09  it indicates, for defensive driving, "To prevent
        10  accidents by trying to anticipate hazardous
        11  situations and adjusting driver behavior to
        12  compensate."  True?
        13       A.   That's what it states, yes.
        14       Q.   And for "Description," it says, "The
        15  defensive driver tries to recognize potentially
        16  hazardous situations in advance to allow time to
        17  safely maneuver past them."  Right?
        18       A.   Yeah, it says a defensive driver
        19  tries to recognize potential hazards,
        20  situations.  Yes.
        21       Q.   "The defensive driver assumes that
        22  other drivers may make mistakes and is on guard
        23  in the event an error is made."  Right?
        24       A.   That's what it states, yes.
        25       Q.   "The defensive driver searches ahead
  00174:01  of what is immediately in front, to have advance
        02  warning of approaching hazards."
        03       A.   Is that a question or a statement?
        04       Q.   It's a question.
        05       A.   Okay.  That's what it says, yes.
        06       Q.   Do you periodically have a qualified
        07  person ride along with the drivers to evaluate
        08  their defensive driving habits?
        09       A.   We do, yes.
        10       Q.   When did a qualified person ride
        11  along with Volunteer Express's driver Connelly?
        12       A.   Well, we did a Smith System training
        13  program ride-along with Defendant Connelly.
        14  Actually, I did that myself when they were first
        15  hired.  And we recertify them in that course
        16  after two years.  Enough time had not passed for
        17  a ride-along to occur.
        18       Q.   Are Volunteer Express's drivers aware
        19  of the concept of preventable accident?
        20       A.   I can't answer for them on whether
        21  they are or are not.
        22       Q.   Because Volunteer Express does not
        23  train its drivers on preventable accidents,
        24  true?
        25       A.   We don't use the terms "preventable"
  00175:01  and "non-preventable" in our training program.
        02                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we go to the
        03  next one, please.
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  The next one
        05  being questions?
        06                 MR. SKIVER:  Next is illness --
        07  sorry.  Next page.  Illness and fatigue.
        08                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  There we go.
        09  BY MR. SKIVER:
        10       Q.   So the objective of this
        11  countermeasure is to "Prevent accidents caused
        12  by ill and fatigued drivers through the use of
        13  common sense and compliance with FMCSRs
        14  regarding physical qualifications and hours of
        15  service," right?
        16       A.   Yes, that's what it states.
        17       Q.   So that would be done partially by
        18  reviewing a driver's driver logs, right?
        19       A.   No.  That's not the way the FMCSA is
        20  stating that there.
        21       Q.   So for the hours of service, the
        22  driver's logs are not used?
        23       A.   No, the driver's logs are, but you
        24  mentioned ride-alongs.  We would use the
        25  driver's logs and we would make sure that they
  00176:01  were qualified per a medical examiner for the
        02  FMCSA regulations for medical examinations of
        03  drivers.
        04       Q.   Defendant Connelly's -- sorry.
        05  Strike that.
        06            Volunteer Express's truck had an
        07  electronic logging device at the time of the
        08  crash, right?
        09       A.   Correct.  Yes, it did.
        10       Q.   And Volunteer Express did not
        11  preserve those hours of service, correct?
        12       A.   Volunteer Express preserved that in
        13  good faith for over three years before someone
        14  accidently discarded the information, yes.
        15       Q.   So that evidence has been destroyed
        16  of whether Defendant Connelly was violating the
        17  hours of service, right?
        18       A.   The actual log from the truck, yes,
        19  has been destroyed.
        20                 MR. SKIVER:  The next page on
        21  this, please.
        22  BY MR. SKIVER:
        23       Q.   So this talks about using and
        24  changing lanes, right?  So a driver must look to
        25  see if there is vehicles next to him before
  00177:01  changing lanes?
        02       A.   Correct.  We use what we call "SMOG":
        03  Signal, mirror, over the shoulder, go.  That's
        04  taught as part of the Smith System.  It requires
        05  you to take your eyes off the roadway briefly in
        06  order to make sure that you have safe passage to
        07  change lanes from right to left.
        08       Q.   Is the driver --
        09       A.   Left to right.
        10       Q.   Is the driver supposed to take their
        11  foot off the accelerator?
        12       A.   When they change lanes?  No.
        13       Q.   Is the driver supposed to brake
        14  before they change lanes?
        15       A.   Not typically.
        16                 MR. SKIVER:  Go to the next
        17  page, please.  Brake performance.
        18  BY MR. SKIVER:
        19       Q.   Was this truck preserved so that a
        20  brake inspection could be performed?
        21       A.   Absolutely.  We still have custody of
        22  it.
        23       Q.   Okay.  So we have the ability to go
        24  and take a look at the truck?
        25       A.   Absolutely, yes.
  00178:01                 MR. SKIVER:  You can take that
        02  down now.  Thank you.
        03  BY MR. SKIVER:
        04       Q.   Volunteer Express is familiar with
        05  the National Safety Council's guide to determine
        06  motor vehicle collision preventability, right?
        07       A.   No.
        08       Q.   So Volunteer Express has not reviewed
        09  that document just like it has not reviewed that
        10  prior document about the USDOT's Federal Motor
        11  Carrier Safety Administration Preventable
        12  Accident Manual, true?
        13       A.   There are numerous documents of that
        14  type by numerous agencies and companies across
        15  the country, and we have not reviewed all of
        16  them, no.
        17       Q.   And so Volunteer Express has not
        18  reviewed the United States Department of
        19  Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        20  Administration Preventable Accident Manual or
        21  the National Safety Council's A Guide to
        22  Determine Motor Vehicle Collision
        23  Preventability?
        24       A.   Not that I recall.
        25                 MR. SKIVER:  Can you please pull
  00179:01  up number 12, which is now going to be
        02  Exhibit 20.
        03                 (Exhibit No. 20 marked for
        04                  identification.)
        05                 MR. SKIVER:  And Mr. Lorincz,
        06  can you please toggle?
        07                 THE WITNESS:  Sure.
        08                 MR. SKIVER:  I don't know why it
        09  does that every time, but it takes you off and
        10  puts you in black.
        11                 THE WITNESS:  Hang on a second
        12  here, it's -- there we go.  I'm back.  I think.
        13                 MR. SKIVER:  Thank you, yeah.
        14  BY MR. SKIVER:
        15       Q.   Looking at Exhibit 20 --
        16                 MR. SKIVER:  If we can turn to
        17  the next page, please.
        18       A.   Can I ask what year this was created?
        19  Does it have a date when it was created?
        20  BY MR. SKIVER:
        21       Q.   This one has a copyright at the
        22  bottom of 2021.
        23       A.   Yeah, okay.
        24       Q.   Does Volunteer Express believe that
        25  the driving of a truck to avoid front-end
  00180:01  collisions has changed from 2017 to 2021?
        02       A.   No.  I just believe the data in this
        03  pamphlet may have changed between that time
        04  period.
        05       Q.   Well, let's see if this data would
        06  have prevented the crash in this case.  When we
        07  look to the bottom where it says, "Front-End
        08  Collisions," it says, "Regardless of the abrupt
        09  or unexpected stop of the vehicle ahead, a
        10  professional driver can prevent front-end
        11  collisions by maintaining a safe following
        12  distance at all times."  Right?
        13       A.   Yes, but you can't create a safe
        14  following distance between an object that isn't
        15  in the roadway yet.
        16       Q.   Are professional truck drivers taught
        17  to anticipate a hazard coming into the roadway?
        18       A.   Yeah, we teach them to keep a lookout
        19  for it.  They try to.
        20       Q.   So this front-end collision and being
        21  prepared "includes being prepared for possible
        22  obstructions on the highway -- either in plain
        23  view or hidden by the crest of a hill/curve of a
        24  roadway."  True?
        25       A.   Is that -- I'm trying to read that.
  00181:01  I didn't see that in here.  There it is.  I see
        02  it.  I see it.
        03       Q.   So yes, that's accurate?
        04       A.   Yeah, that's what this states.
        05       Q.   Do you disagree with that?
        06       A.   I don't disagree that it's possible
        07  to prevent a front-end collision that way.  But
        08  I don't agree that it can always prevent a
        09  front-end collision that way.
        10                 MR. SKIVER:  You can mark this
        11  as the point -- what is it?  20.1, please.
        12                 (Exhibit No. 20.1 marked for
        13                  identification.)
        14                 MR. SKIVER:  And then take it
        15  down, please.  Thank you.
        16  BY MR. SKIVER:
        17       Q.   What is a safety --
        18                 MR. SKIVER:  I'm sorry.  Can we
        19  have Mr. Lorincz as the main spotlight again?
        20  BY MR. SKIVER:
        21       Q.   What is a safety culture?
        22       A.   A safety culture?  A safety culture
        23  is a mindset.  It's where our drivers know that
        24  our goal is to excel, to be safe, professional,
        25  accountable in everything we do, be the low cost
  00182:01  provider, run lean and efficient while
        02  maintaining the highest standard of safety,
        03  service and compliance.
        04            It's about being safe, with every
        05  driver coming home every day, every trip, every
        06  time.  Protecting the motoring public and doing
        07  everything within our capacity to make sure that
        08  that truck is being operated in a safe and
        09  compliant manner.  That's a safety culture.
        10       Q.   And did Volunteer Express's driver
        11  and Volunteer Express do everything they
        12  possibly can to make sure that they were being
        13  as safe as possible in this crash?
        14       A.   We won awards for our safety
        15  performance because of our safety culture.  We
        16  had some of the lowest CSA scores in the
        17  industry --
        18                 MR. SKIVER:  Objection, not
        19  responsive, move to strike.
        20  BY MR. SKIVER:
        21       Q.   That was not my question.  My
        22  question was did Volunteer Express and its
        23  driver do everything it possibly could to excel
        24  and be as safe as possible leading up to this
        25  crash?
  00183:01       A.   Yes, I believe so.
        02       Q.   Volunteer Express is familiar with
        03  the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        04  Administration's "Commercial Truck and Bus
        05  Safety Synthesis 14:  The Role of Safety Culture
        06  in Preventing Motor Vehicle Crashes," right?
        07       A.   I don't know if I am or not.  Is this
        08  a document?
        09       Q.   Yes.
        10                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we please pull
        11  up 13, which we will mark as 21.
        12                 (Exhibit No. 21 marked for
        13                  identification.)
        14                 MR. SKIVER:  Can you please
        15  toggle, Mr. Lorincz?
        16                 THE WITNESS:  Yep.  Seems to do
        17  it every time, don't it?
        18                 MR. SKIVER:  Yep.
        19                 THE WITNESS:  There we go.
        20       A.   No.  I do not recall ever seeing this
        21  document.
        22                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.  Can you
        23  please take that one down?
        24  BY MR. SKIVER:
        25       Q.   Does --
  00184:01                 MR. SKIVER:  And can you please
        02  put Mr. Lorincz up?
        03  BY MR. SKIVER:
        04       Q.   Does Volunteer Express believe that
        05  safety starts at the top?
        06       A.   Absolutely.
        07       Q.   So a company is only going to be as
        08  safe as their director of safety?
        09       A.   Actually, I'd say it's higher than
        10  that.  You have to have support from the
        11  president of the company to create a safety
        12  culture.
        13       Q.   Does Volunteer Express have complete
        14  support from its president to --
        15       A.   Absolutely.
        16       Q.   Sorry, you have to let me finish.
        17       A.   Sorry.  Go ahead.
        18       Q.   Does Volunteer Express have support
        19  from its president to instill the exact safety
        20  culture that you wanted as the director of
        21  safety?
        22       A.   Yes.
        23       Q.   A safety culture means that what a
        24  trucking company allows will continue, right?
        25                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Object to the
  00185:01  form of the question.  Vague and ambiguous.
        02       A.   Yeah, I can't tell -- is that a
        03  statement?  Can you specify a little better what
        04  you're trying to get at?
        05                 MR. SKIVER:  And, Jerry, I think
        06  your objections are form and foundation as
        07  opposed to coaching the witness about what their
        08  response may be.
        09                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Well, let
        10  tell me you, Ryan, that if I just say "form"
        11  that sometimes don't work if there is an issue.
        12                 MR. SKIVER:  I thought that we
        13  said at the beginning all objections were
        14  reserved except for form and foundation.
        15                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Right.  That
        16  was my form objection.  So the point if the
        17  objection is form can mean a lot of different
        18  things to a lot of different lawyers.
        19                 MR. SKIVER:  And form covers all
        20  of that, correct?
        21                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Well, if you
        22  are willing to accept form as sufficient, that's
        23  what it will be as well.
        24                 MR. SKIVER:  Absolutely.
        25  BY MR. SKIVER:
  00186:01       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, if a trucking company --
        02  sorry.  Hang on one second.
        03            What a trucking company allows as
        04  part of its safety culture will continue, true?
        05       A.   I don't know if --
        06                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Same
        07  objection, form.
        08       A.   I don't know what you mean by "will
        09  continue."
        10  BY MR. SKIVER:
        11       Q.   Meaning --
        12       A.   Because it's constantly changing and
        13  developing and becoming better is what we shoot
        14  for.
        15       Q.   Okay.  And so you are saying
        16  Volunteer Express has consistently gotten better
        17  with safety?
        18       A.   Oh, evidenced by our results, yes.
        19       Q.   If a trucking company does not follow
        20  its own policies and procedures, you would
        21  expect the same thing of its truck drivers?
        22       A.   I don't know that I would.
        23       Q.   You would expect the truck drivers to
        24  do a better job of following the policies and
        25  procedures of the company than the company does?
  00187:01       A.   I would think that every individual
        02  has the personal capacity to either follow or
        03  not follow company policy.  And I can't say that
        04  this clerk that didn't follow a policy over here
        05  means that my drivers won't follow a policy over
        06  there.  That's subjective.
        07       Q.   But certainly as the director of
        08  safety you always follow the policies?
        09       A.   My goal is to always follow the
        10  policies that we had in place.  When it came to
        11  administering the policies, that was my role,
        12  yes.
        13            When it came to things like filling
        14  out that incident investigation form, that
        15  wasn't written specifically to throw in a
        16  drivers file.  It was written to make sure that
        17  we got the information from the driver that we
        18  needed.
        19       Q.   And so you as the director of safety
        20  chose not to follow Volunteer Express's policy
        21  with regard to --
        22       A.   No, I documented --
        23       Q.   Can you please let me finish?
        24       A.   Go ahead.
        25       Q.   So you as the director of safety for
  00188:01  Volunteer Express chose not to follow the policy
        02  of creating the incident investigation form?
        03       A.   I documented it in a different
        04  format.
        05       Q.   That format that has now been
        06  destroyed or lost, correct?
        07       A.   That's my understanding, yes.
        08                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we please pull
        09  up 14, which we'll now mark as Exhibit 22.
        10                 (Exhibit No. 22 marked for
        11                  identification.)
        12                 MR. SKIVER:  And can you scroll
        13  through the Bates numbers of 272 through 278.
        14  BY MR. SKIVER:
        15       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, can you please toggle?
        16  Did you get a chance to look at Exhibit 22?
        17       A.   The incident investigation form?
        18       Q.   It's actually a larger document
        19  with --
        20       A.   Yes.  I'm familiar with it.
        21       Q.   And that is a -- one of the policies
        22  and procedures of Volunteer Express, correct?
        23       A.   Oh, that's guidelines, yes.  It's not
        24  necessarily the -- the policy.  Some of it is
        25  guidelines.  So which specific Bates number are
  00189:01  you referring to with your question?  Because
        02  there is multiple sections to this form.
        03       Q.   So can you please tell me what
        04  portions of Exhibit 22 you believe you did not
        05  have to follow?
        06       A.   Well, first off, it's written
        07  specifically in a couple of different formats.
        08  It's written for a manager and it's written for
        09  the driver, for what the manager's
        10  responsibilities are and what the driver's
        11  responsibilities are.  Then there's guidelines
        12  for the terminal on the best ways to capture
        13  this information and make sure that they're
        14  following the policy.
        15       Q.   Was the --
        16       A.   And all of that information is
        17  reported to the director of safety.
        18       Q.   Was the manager involved in this
        19  crash investigation?
        20       A.   The manager referred them directly to
        21  me as soon as they found out that it happened.
        22       Q.   Why?
        23       A.   So this information would have been a
        24  conversation with me and Ms. Connelly.  As in
        25  regards to Bates numbers 273, 274, 275.  278 was
  00190:01  the process we used for DOT post-accident tests.
        02  279 is the driver's responsibilities.
        03       Q.   This one only goes to 278.
        04       A.   Oh, I'm sorry.
        05       Q.   So, again, this information is the
        06  information that was destroyed, correct?
        07       A.   Correct.  This would have been on my
        08  notepad.  I created the document.  I know this
        09  stuff step by step, heart by heart.  So I didn't
        10  have to reference a document to write down
        11  answers to questions I already wrote.
        12       Q.   So you knew exactly what you had to
        13  do by heart?
        14       A.   I had a lot of accidents to deal with
        15  in my career over 12, 13 years.
        16                 MR. SKIVER:  Can you please
        17  close that down?
        18  BY MR. SKIVER:
        19       Q.   How many accidents have you had to
        20  deal with over your career?
        21       A.   I couldn't put a number on that.
        22  Honestly, I worked for multiple different
        23  companies.
        24       Q.   It's too many?
        25       A.   It would be way too many for me to
  00191:01  try to come up with a number.  Several hundred.
        02       Q.   Several hundred.  And were you the
        03  director of safety for those other companies as
        04  well?
        05       A.   Not at all of them, no.
        06       Q.   Some of them you were, though?
        07       A.   At one of them I was.
        08       Q.   Okay.  And what -- the time that you
        09  were acting as the director of safety for these
        10  two companies, how many crashes happened under
        11  your watch?
        12       A.   You mean for this company as director
        13  of safety, for Volunteer?
        14       Q.   You said -- well, was there another
        15  company you were director of safety for?
        16       A.   No.  You said, "these two companies"
        17  you were director of safety.  I was only
        18  director at that -- I was just a regional
        19  manager under someone else at the other company.
        20       Q.   Okay.  So under this company,
        21  Volunteer Express, how many crashes have
        22  happened under your watch?
        23       A.   Let's see here.  I honestly
        24  couldn't -- I can't give you an exact number of
        25  that off the top of my head.  Apologize for
  00192:01  that, but I just can't.  I don't know them.
        02       Q.   Too many -- too many to keep track
        03  of?
        04       A.   Is ten too many to keep track of?  Is
        05  20 too many to keep track of?  That's a
        06  subjective question.  Right now, I can't give
        07  you a definitive number of how many accidents we
        08  had.
        09       Q.   Because you haven't kept track of
        10  them?
        11       A.   No, we kept track of them.  I just
        12  don't remember it off the top of my head.
        13       Q.   Do you remember information that's
        14  important to you?
        15       A.   Typically.
        16       Q.   But this information you do not
        17  remember about how many crashes have happened
        18  under your watch?
        19       A.   Typically, I pay attention more to
        20  the crashes that we can learn something from or
        21  crashes that have a serious injury.  And I
        22  disregard things that I would have classified as
        23  a crash that no one else would have.  So I
        24  classify a lot of things as a crash that other
        25  people don't.
  00193:01       Q.   So you disregarded this crash because
        02  it wasn't something that your company could have
        03  prevented?
        04       A.   No, we fully -- we fully investigated
        05  this crash.
        06       Q.   Okay.  But you didn't think there was
        07  anything you could have done to prevent it?
        08       A.   I didn't find anything that our
        09  driver had done to violate FMCSA regulation or
        10  company policy.
        11       Q.   There are lots of recommendations for
        12  policies and procedures to prevent distracted
        13  driving, right?
        14       A.   I'm sure, yes.
        15       Q.   What are some of those
        16  recommendations to prevent distracted driving?
        17       A.   I couldn't quote you theoretical
        18  documents of people I don't know who put them
        19  out there.  Most people would say you want to
        20  put into place a policy that says don't use cell
        21  phones.  There may be a policy in place that
        22  says don't eat food while you're driving.
        23            Best practices that I'm aware of
        24  would be to make sure we're educating our
        25  drivers in some form or fashion on the dangers
  00194:01  of distracted driving and the different types of
        02  distracted driving that may occur.
        03            And typically, writing a policy to
        04  affect the most -- most used or most often items
        05  that are distracting, like cell phones or
        06  hand-held devices, which we did at Volunteer
        07  Express.  We have a policy for that.
        08       Q.   Did Volunteer Express have a clear
        09  policy about shutting off cell phones?
        10       A.   And -- can you clarify a little bit
        11  more on what you're looking for there?
        12       Q.   Well, did Volunteer Express have any
        13  policy about shutting off cell phones?
        14       A.   Did we require you to turn off your
        15  cell phone while you're driving a truck?  No, we
        16  did not.
        17       Q.   Did Volunteer Express lock down
        18  job-related electronics while their trucks are
        19  moving?
        20       A.   Yes.
        21       Q.   Volunteer Express had a Qualcomm
        22  system in place in the truck involved in this
        23  crash, true?
        24       A.   False.
        25       Q.   So Volunteer Express did not have a
  00195:01  Qualcomm system in place in the truck that was
        02  involved in this crash, correct?
        03       A.   No, we did not.  We had a PeopleNet
        04  system in the truck.
        05                 MR. SKIVER:  Can we please pull
        06  up 29.  I believe we're up to Exhibit 23.  Can
        07  you please toggle, Mr. Lorincz?
        08                 (Exhibit No. 23 marked for
        09                  identification.)
        10  BY MR. SKIVER:
        11       Q.   Have you ever seen this "Sample
        12  Distracted Driving Policy" from the National
        13  Safety Council?
        14       A.   No, I have not.
        15       Q.   As the director of safety did you
        16  look online or anywhere else for good policies
        17  and procedures to follow to make sure that your
        18  trucks are safe?
        19       A.   Absolutely.
        20       Q.   But you never went to the National
        21  Safety Council to try to find a safety policy on
        22  distracted driving?
        23       A.   The National Safety Council, many of
        24  their documents are behind a paywall.  And there
        25  were numerous other free resources available to
  00196:01  reference.
        02       Q.   So Volunteer Express believes that
        03  its policies and procedures are to the highest
        04  standard of safety?
        05       A.   We believe so, yes.
        06                 MR. SKIVER:  You can take down
        07  23.
        08  BY MR. SKIVER:
        09       Q.   Volunteer Express's policy on their
        10  drivers' appearance is longer than the policy on
        11  distracted driving, true?
        12       A.   True.  It's an operations policy, and
        13  I didn't write it.
        14       Q.   When did Volunteer Express first
        15  learn of this crash?
        16       A.   When did we first learn of this
        17  crash?  If I remember correctly, somewhere
        18  around 10:00, 11:00 a.m. on November 2nd, 2017.
        19       Q.   How did Volunteer Express first learn
        20  of this crash?
        21       A.   A telephone call to dispatch from
        22  Ms. Connelly, and that cell phone call was
        23  forwarded directly to me.
        24       Q.   And obviously this isn't your first
        25  rodeo, so you knew when you received that call
  00197:01  that litigation was likely in this case?
        02       A.   In every accident we prepare for
        03  litigation because it's the environment we
        04  operate in.
        05       Q.   And you said the adjuster went to the
        06  crash scene within the first 24 to 48 hours?
        07       A.   I'm assuming so.  I don't know that
        08  that's exactly when they went to the crash.  I
        09  know we engaged with an adjuster within the
        10  first 24 to 48 hours.  I can't recall off the
        11  top of my head the exact time and date the
        12  adjuster showed up on the actual scene.
        13       Q.   When did you first receive the
        14  preservation letter dated February 21, 2018?
        15       A.   I believe it was first handed to me
        16  in March of 2018 is when I -- actually was
        17  handed to me.  I'm not sure when it arrived at
        18  the corporate office, but it would have been
        19  given to me by the secretary at the front desk
        20  when people deliver -- where they deliver the
        21  mail.
        22       Q.   Volunteer Express keeps accurate
        23  records for all of its drivers, true?
        24       A.   We sure -- we try to.  I would say to
        25  the best of our abilities, yes.
  00198:01       Q.   Volunteer Express provided all
        02  documents in its possession relating to its
        03  driver Connelly?
        04       A.   In relation to this production, yes.
        05       Q.   I think we have -- let's see.  That's
        06  not separate.  Did Volunteer Express ever have
        07  Qualcomm for its drivers?
        08       A.   Yes, we do.
        09       Q.   When?
        10       A.   At the time that Ms. Connelly was
        11  hired, Qualcomm would have been the system in
        12  the trucks.  We started the process of
        13  transferring that ELD system out and putting in
        14  an upgraded ELD system in August of 2017.  And
        15  that continued all the way through December.
        16       Q.   So the PeopleNet would have taken
        17  over the communications aspect of a Qualcomm
        18  system?
        19       A.   Absolutely, yes.
        20       Q.   And I'm sorry.  Did you say the 2016
        21  Volvo tractor had -- is it -- do you call it an
        22  ECM or an EER?
        23       A.   I would tell you it's got an ECM in
        24  it.  All I know is you have to -- you have to
        25  use an engineering company to come and look at
  00199:01  those things because they are so picky.
        02       Q.   The 2016 Volvo tractor that was
        03  involved in this crash, did it have any
        04  available front collision avoidance systems?
        05       A.   Not that I'm aware of, no.
        06       Q.   Are you aware if front collision
        07  avoidance systems were available on that model
        08  of a 2016 Volvo tractor?
        09       A.   I don't know if that they were
        10  available on that model or not.  I know that
        11  they were available on many types of trucks.
        12       Q.   Volunteer Express did not order the
        13  2016 Volvo tractors with front collision
        14  avoidance systems, true?
        15       A.   To my understanding, yes.  I wasn't
        16  part of the team that ordered the trucks.
        17       Q.   What are MVIRs?
        18       A.   What are -- excuse me?  Can you say
        19  that again?
        20       Q.   Sure.  What are MVIRs?
        21       A.   MVIR?  Motor vehicle inspection
        22  records.
        23       Q.   Volunteer Express required its
        24  drivers to complete motor vehicle inspection
        25  reports, true?
  00200:01       A.   We -- we asked them to do DVIR is
        02  what we called it, driver vehicle inspection
        03  record.  It's the same thing, just different
        04  term.  And we required them to complete a DVIR
        05  before each trip and at the end of each trip as
        06  required per FMCSA regulations and any time they
        07  changed out equipment.
        08       Q.   Where are the DVIRs from the truck
        09  involved in this crash?
        10       A.   It's my understanding they would be
        11  with the paper file that was left in Nashville.
        12       Q.   So do those still exist or have those
        13  been destroyed?
        14       A.   My understanding is they weren't able
        15  to be presented.  They would not be here.
        16  They'd be destroyed with the rest of it or
        17  misplaced, whatever they did with it.
        18       Q.   So those DVIR reports for the truck
        19  involved in this crash no longer exist, true?
        20       A.   True.  Let me state part of that is
        21  the DVIR reports themselves were done digitally
        22  on the ELD.
        23       Q.   So those would have been included
        24  with the PeopleNet --
        25       A.   Yeah.
  00201:01       Q.   -- ELD that was overwritten?
        02       A.   Correct.  But if I recall correctly,
        03  I printed both the logs and the DVIRs and
        04  reviewed them as part of my investigation, which
        05  would have placed them in that paper file.
        06       Q.   And, again, that paper file has been
        07  destroyed?
        08       A.   Correct.
        09       Q.   And Volunteer Express did not obtain
        10  any cell phone records or any mirroring of the
        11  phone from its driver Connelly, correct?
        12       A.   Yeah, as stated previously to this
        13  question, no, we did not get any telephone
        14  records from Defendant Connelly.
        15       Q.   And I think we discussed this too,
        16  but just to be sure, the same thing for the
        17  Garmin and any data associated with that, that
        18  was not preserved, right?
        19       A.   Correct.
        20       Q.   Was this a DOT reportable event?
        21       A.   Yes.
        22       Q.   You indicated earlier that the
        23  adjuster went to the scene of the crash and took
        24  photos.  Where are those photos?
        25       A.   Those photographs and all the
  00202:01  documents that we had were presented to our
        02  legal representation.  And I'm not sure --
        03  they're not included in this, which would lead
        04  me to believe there is some form of work product
        05  as the classification for them.
        06       Q.   So you're familiar with the term
        07  "work product"?
        08       A.   A little bit.
        09       Q.   Where is the other documentation
        10  that's required of Volunteer Express's drivers
        11  at the crash scene?
        12       A.   Could you clarify, please?
        13       Q.   Well, is there documentation that's
        14  required of Volunteer Express's drivers at the
        15  crash scene?
        16       A.   At the crash scene they wouldn't fill
        17  out anything other than anything the police
        18  officer handed to them.
        19       Q.   Did Defendant Connelly give any type
        20  of recorded or written statement to Volunteer
        21  Express?
        22       A.   Recorded statement?  Honestly, let me
        23  think about it.  I don't recall receiving an
        24  actual recorded statement from Defendant
        25  Connelly.  I know we had several conversations,
  00203:01  and I don't believe that she had written out a
        02  physical accident report.
        03       Q.   Where are the Smith System quizzes
        04  that are supposed to be done quarterly?
        05       A.   Smith System quizzes are not required
        06  to be done quarterly.
        07       Q.   So Volunteer Express doesn't have a
        08  policy that requires the Smith System quizzes to
        09  be done quarterly?
        10       A.   No.  We follow the Smith System's
        11  program, which requires it to be done every two
        12  years.
        13       Q.   Does Volunteer Express take any
        14  responsibility for the crash?
        15       A.   At this point we're still under the
        16  belief that defendant -- or Plaintiff Cajiao's
        17  actions were the proximate cause of the crash
        18  and would they have not pulled off to the
        19  shoulder of the roadway with a disabled
        20  commercial motor vehicle, this crash would have
        21  never happened.
        22       Q.   So Volunteer Express does not take
        23  any responsibility for the crash, true?
        24       A.   We do not believe that we were at
        25  fault, no.
  00204:01       Q.   And if an expert said Volunteer
        02  Express had fault, you would disagree with that?
        03       A.   Depends on the expert.
        04       Q.   So you may change your mind if a
        05  trucking expert says that Volunteer Express has
        06  fault?
        07       A.   I can't claim to know whether any
        08  particular caliber of expert is going to be
        09  correct or incorrect in their examination of the
        10  incident, the accident, and whether or not I
        11  agree with their statements or their opinions,
        12  because much of what they'll provide is opinion.
        13       Q.   What, if anything, do you believe
        14  Volunteer Express's driver Connelly did wrong?
        15       A.   Again, Defendant Mrs. Connelly was
        16  not in violation of Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        17  Regulations or any company policy at the time of
        18  the crash.
        19       Q.   So Volunteer Express does not believe
        20  that Connelly did anything wrong, correct?
        21       A.   Again --
        22                 MR. SKIVER:  Lost him again.
        23                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Going
        24  off the video.  The time is now 1:29 p.m.
        25         (At 1:29 p.m. - Recess)
  00205:01         (At 1:33 p.m., with all parties present
        02  as before, the following proceedings were had,
        03  to-wit:)
        04                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the
        05  record 1:33 p.m.  You may proceed.
        06                 MR. SKIVER:  Thank you.  Can you
        07  please spotlight Mr. Lorincz?
        08  BY MR. SKIVER:
        09       Q.   Mr. Lorincz, I believe at the
        10  beginning you said that you were certified as a
        11  director of safety.  Was that by the national --
        12  North American transportation institute?
        13       A.   North American Transportation
        14  Management Institute and the University of
        15  Central Florida.
        16       Q.   What book did you use in that course
        17  to be certified?
        18       A.   It wasn't a specific book.  It was
        19  multiple courses that you had to take which were
        20  done through NATMI courses at the Tennessee
        21  Trucking Association.  And in addition you had
        22  to provide a portfolio of all of the safety
        23  progress that you have made to show that you
        24  qualified by experience as well.
        25       Q.   I'm sorry.  I don't remember if I
  00206:01  asked you this or not.  You talked about an
        02  online learning platform.  What was the online
        03  learning platform?
        04       A.   Vertical Alliance, and the platform
        05  that we used was the Infinit-I i2 platform.
        06       Q.   When you are looking for information
        07  on safety policies and procedures, where do you
        08  go to find them?
        09       A.   Numerous sources.  I go to peers
        10  within the industry.  I go to online sources,
        11  whether it's some of them are inside the
        12  country, some of them are outside the country.
        13  Look at different research reports a lot of
        14  times from various locations with the intent of
        15  getting multiple perspectives and using those to
        16  formulate a good perspective for a safety
        17  process or policy that would be effective.
        18       Q.   Is there a specific online source
        19  that you go to frequently?
        20       A.   Frequently?  ATRI.  A-T-R-I.  The
        21  American Transportation Research Institute.
        22       Q.   Thank you.  Anything else?
        23       A.   Sometimes I've went to the NTSB.  At
        24  other times I go to the FMCSA websites.  I've
        25  gone to keeptrucking.org for ideas for safety
  00207:01  training.
        02            Sometimes I'll look through J.J.
        03  Keller's material.  Sometimes I'll attend their
        04  webinars.  I go to a lot of other webinars from
        05  companies like Tenstreet, J.J. Keller, Vigilo.
        06            Sometimes I'll go to the -- the
        07  insurance company webinars on different topics
        08  typically presented by Cottingham & Butler Claim
        09  Services.
        10            And at other times I'll attend
        11  in-person seminars or go to the trucking
        12  association meetings or ask the local trucking
        13  association for example policies from other
        14  carriers.
        15            So a little bit of everything.
        16       Q.   Do you know who Swift Transportation
        17  is?
        18       A.   Swift?  Yeah, I know who Swift is.
        19       Q.   Do you believe Volunteer Express is
        20  as safe as Swift Transportation?
        21       A.   I believe our CSA scores would show
        22  that we are safer.
        23       Q.   So Volunteer Express likely knows
        24  more about crash -- crash prevention than Swift
        25  Transportation?
  00208:01       A.   I don't know that we know more about
        02  prevention than Swift Transportation, prevention
        03  of crashes.  I would say that we had an
        04  effective safety system and management controls
        05  that help reduce our safety scores, help make us
        06  safer.
        07       Q.   Does Volunteer Express know that
        08  rear-end crashes are completely preventable?
        09       A.   I don't necessarily agree that
        10  rear-end crashes are completely preventable.  It
        11  depends on circumstance.  The majority of them
        12  are.
        13       Q.   Does Volunteer Express know that
        14  rear-end crashes are completely avoidable?
        15       A.   Again, I reiterate the same answer.
        16  I don't necessarily agree that all of them are
        17  completely avoidable.  I believe that there are
        18  circumstances in which a rear-end crash may not
        19  be avoidable.
        20       Q.   Is Volunteer Express as safe as
        21  Werner Enterprises?
        22       A.   I'd like to think so.
        23       Q.   Does Volunteer Express know as much
        24  or more than Werner on crash prevention?
        25       A.   I have no way to answer that because
  00209:01  I don't know what they know.
        02       Q.   What was Volunteer Express's annual
        03  safety budget?
        04       A.   Our annual safety budget?  We didn't
        05  operate off of a safety budget.
        06       Q.   So Volunteer Express had no safety
        07  budget?
        08       A.   We didn't have a specific safety
        09  budget, no.  We literally put in place the
        10  systems and processes and things that we needed.
        11  There was no need to have a set dollar amount
        12  that would hold us back from being safer.
        13       Q.   Having driver-facing dash cams would
        14  be safer, true?
        15       A.   There's some opinions of that.  I
        16  don't necessarily agree with that.
        17       Q.   So Volunteer Express had no financial
        18  limitation to prevent them from having
        19  driving-facing cameras?
        20       A.   That's not what I said.  I said I
        21  didn't have a budget to hold us back.  We still
        22  had to seek approval for things that we wanted
        23  to put in place.
        24       Q.   Did you seek approval to have
        25  driver-facing dash cams?
  00210:01       A.   We actually did some discussions with
        02  several camera system companies in relation to
        03  placing them in.  But, by the time I left, we
        04  had not actually came to the position of getting
        05  them installed.
        06       Q.   When did you start looking into
        07  driver-facing dash cams for Volunteer Express?
        08       A.   It wasn't necessarily driver facing.
        09  It was facing forward and driver.  And I started
        10  looking at them within the first year or two of
        11  me working for the company.
        12       Q.   And I'm sorry, did you say that was
        13  2012?
        14       A.   When I started working for them?
        15       Q.   Yeah.
        16       A.   No, 2014.
        17       Q.   Oh, '14, sorry.  Okay.  So as early
        18  as 2014, you started looking into both
        19  outward-facing and driver-facing dash cams for
        20  Volunteer Express, true?
        21       A.   Correct.
        22       Q.   And Volunteer Express never actually
        23  purchased any type of dash cam, whether it be
        24  outward-facing or driver-facing, in that time
        25  that you worked there?
  00211:01       A.   They couldn't give us the safety
        02  features we demanded.
        03       Q.   That wasn't my question.  My question
        04  was Volunteer Express never actually purchased
        05  any outward-facing or driving-facing cameras for
        06  the dash --
        07       A.   No, we did not -- sorry.  No, we did
        08  not, because they never met our demands of what
        09  we wanted for safety features.
        10       Q.   What were your demands that you
        11  wanted for safety features for a driver-facing
        12  dash cam?
        13       A.   Well, we wanted several things, in
        14  fact.  We wanted to make sure we had shock
        15  triggers so if you hit something and you
        16  couldn't see what it was, it would trigger an
        17  alarm so that we would notify -- we would be
        18  notified.
        19            We wanted the system to be able to
        20  talk to our ELD so we knew exactly what driver
        21  was driving the truck when something happened so
        22  that we could follow up on those things.
        23            And those things were not in there.
        24  A single sign-on between devices just became
        25  available in the last year or two.  There were
  00212:01  other things as well.  I don't recall what all
        02  of them were off the top of my head, but those
        03  were two of the major ones we were looking for.
        04       Q.   So Volunteer Express's ELD could not
        05  tell them who was driving their truck?
        06       A.   No, the ELD and camera system could
        07  not talk to each other so that when the driver
        08  logged into the ELD in the truck, the camera
        09  would know who was driving the truck.
        10       Q.   Was there a lot of issue with drivers
        11  at Volunteer Express driving under someone
        12  else's name?
        13       A.   No.  That wasn't an issue at all.
        14  But it's much better to go to a driver -- and a
        15  lot of these programs or these camera systems
        16  have safety scores and dashboards and things
        17  that are driver specific.
        18            Well, if you don't have a single
        19  sign-on, the driver just might not log in, and
        20  then you don't have that accurate data to be
        21  able to have that safety management control in
        22  place.
        23            So requiring the system to talk to
        24  the ELD so that when the driver logs into the
        25  ELD, the system knows who the driver is,
  00213:01  guarantees that that driver's safety record
        02  follows them.  And that gives you a better
        03  management control.
        04       Q.   And you're saying that that option
        05  was not available on any of the driver-facing
        06  dash cams in 2017?
        07       A.   None of the ones that we reviewed.
        08       Q.   Which ones did you review?
        09       A.   We looked at DriveCam.  We looked at
        10  SmartDrive.  Those were the two major camera
        11  companies that were in the field at that time.
        12  They have even -- even now, there's still camera
        13  companies out there, even PeopleNet's own camera
        14  company, that doesn't have a shock trigger.  So
        15  this technology is still being developed.  They
        16  do now talk to the ELD, which is great, so --
        17       Q.   So it was feasible to have
        18  driver-facing cameras in 2017?
        19       A.   If the -- the camera companies could
        20  have made the cameras as safe as we wanted them
        21  to be so that we could properly use them to the
        22  best of our ability, yes, it would be feasible.
        23                 MR. SKIVER:  Objection.  Move to
        24  strike.  Nonresponsive.
        25  BY MR. SKIVER:
  00214:01       Q.   It's a simple yes/no question.  Were
        02  driver-facing cameras feasible in 2017?
        03       A.   No.
        04                 MR. SKIVER:  I believe that's
        05  all the questions that I have.  I don't know if
        06  Jerry has any.
        07                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  I don't have
        08  any.
        09                 MR. SKIVER:  Okay.  Do you guys
        10  have to put the read and sign on the record?
        11                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Yes.  We'll
        12  read and sign.
        13                 MR. SKIVER:  Thank you.  Thank
        14  you, Mr. Lorincz, for your time.  I appreciate
        15  it.
        16                 THE WITNESS:  Thank you, sir.
        17                 THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Let me
        18  go off this immediate record.  One moment
        19  please, everyone.  We are going off the record.
        20  This concludes the deposition.  The time is now
        21  1:43 p.m.
        22         (An off-the-record discussion was held.)
        23                 THE COURT REPORTER:  I need
        24  orders on the record as well.
        25                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Give me a
  00215:01  full and a condensed, please.
        02                 THE COURT REPORTER:  Do you want
        03  hard copy or electronic or both?
        04                 MR. FRIEDRICHSEN:  Give me both.
        05                 MR. SKIVER:  Jim, you're a
        06  computer guy.  Whatever you want to do.  I don't
        07  know.
        08                 MR. HARRIS:  Well, I think what
        09  we need is an ASCII text and a PDF condensed.
        10  And I guess we probably get the original, Ryan,
        11  since we took this.
        12                 THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes.
