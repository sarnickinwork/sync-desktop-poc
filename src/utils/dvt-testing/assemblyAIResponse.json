And who did you provide the written statement to? Workman comp. Did you at any time take any photographs of the vehicle that you were driving at the time of the repair? I did my. I think my son got a few of them. The photographs that your son took, did he provide those to you? Yes, ma', am, I have a few. Did you in turn provide those to any supervisor or employee of Hamlin Air? Yeah, Hamlin Air Hamline seen the photographs and workers comp. Seen them. After the wreck.

To your recollection, was there anything in the crash report that was documented incorrectly? Yes, ma'. Am. Okay, and we'll get to that in a minute. But to your recollection, if you remember offhand, what do you believe was documented incorrectly on the wreck? Regarding the wreck? All right, well, the. Where they said that she hit me at. She hit me from the turning lane. They say she hit me from the second lane, and she hit me from the turning lane. So are you saying that she was in the turning lane? Yes, ma'. Am. Which direction was she turning? Left or right? She. She would be turning left towards Tallulah. But I'm not sure if, you know, I'm not sure if she was turning that fast. I mean, you know, if there's just a bunch of contradiction. As far as their police report right there at that moment, Your knowledge was. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Go ahead. I. I said that's okay. Go ahead. I'll wait on you, Red. What was that? Apologize. No, you wanted to expound on your response. Go ahead. I was just saying that, you know, if she was turning left, you know, she was turning fast, you know, I mean, she. She turned me 100, 110 degrees when she hit me. She turned me all the way around into the road, all the way into the lane. So, you know, everybody. Everybody was saying, you know, different things, you know, but she hit me from third lane, so. And they're saying the second lane and that. That's not correct. Yeah. Were you responsible for any type of maintenance on the vehicle that you were driving? No, ma'. Am. All the thing I did was keep it clean. We have a shop. There's a shopping. Shopping making that does all the tires, brakes, all the. All the maintenance, everything. All. They change all. Everything. Only thing we do is keep the inside clean and outside wash. Are you the one who would take it for any maintenance? Yes, ma'. Am. I would have to drop it off. You know, I'd have to go get oil change. I'd have to go everything. And. And they had just given me the truck. We had brand new tires on it, brand new brakes on it. Just had a fresh oil change. I just cleaned it. I mean, it was, you know, it was in real good shape. Prior to this wreck, had you been in any other wrecks in A Hamlin vehicle? No, ma'. Am. Had you had any other wrecks in your own personal vehicle? Yes. Few years before that on the same road. That's the same restaurant on the same road at the other end of the Russell Parkway on Porter Road. Lady pulled out on Porter Road. It.

Do you have any relatives who live in Bibb County? No, ma'. Am. Do you go to church in Bev County? No, ma'. Am. Are you a member of any type of organizations that are located in Bibb County? No, ma'. Am. So you don't coach any sports or anything in Bebb County? No, ma'. Am. Does your son coach any sports in Bev County? No, ma'. Am. I'm going to ask you to review a couple of exhibits, and I hope that you're going to be able to see them. Mr. Roach is going to assist me with. Go through some exhibits with you. Mr. Roach, if you could put up plaintiffs exhibit number one. Mr. Willman, can you see that document on your phone? Yes, ma'. Am. Okay. Can you see it clearly, or do we need to make it a little bit bigger? I mean, that's the same one that y' all sent me in the mail I just got. Okay. That is the second amended notice for your deposition today. So you do recognize this document? Yes. Okay, Mr. Roach, if you could just go to page two of that document and page three of that document. Okay. You did receive all three pages of this document, Mr. Wilmond? Yeah, I believe so. I'll have to look at the paper when it's on my desk at the house, but yes, ma', am, I'm pretty sure that's the same thing I got. Okay. That's plaintiffs exhibit number one. Mr. Oates, you can take that document down. The next exhibit is plaintiff's exhibit number two. Mr. Roach, if you could put that up. Mr. Willman, do you recall receiving plaintiff's first request for admissions to defendant Jason Kelly Willman, the one out. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that for me? Do you recall seeing or receiving a copy of this document? And do I need to make it a little bit Bigger. So you can see it. I'm trying to. Let me ask Mr. Roach to help us so that she can see it a little bit better. Okay. You see that it has the style of the case. My client, Ms. Cassie McKinney. Yeah, I say that. Cassidy McKinney. Yes, ma'. Am. Cassie Denise McKinney. Okay. And you see that. That is in the state court of Bibb County, State of Georgia. Okay. And then you see, it's the first request of admissions to defendant JC Kelly Wellman, who serve upon defendant Jason Kelly when commission required. Defendant just together. Women admit to admit request. 1045 days. Okay. Do you recall receiving this document? I. I don't, but I'll. I'll go through all my stuff and see. But I don't. Okay. Okay, Mr. Roach, if you could go to the second page of that document, maybe that will look a little bit more familiar. And, Mr. Willman, do you recall receiving this document on this page? Does that page look a little bit more familiar to you? That's the truth. I mean, you know, like I said, I mean, I'm not. I'm not sure. I. I'll just have to look when I get home. You know, I'm not far from home. I mean, if you. I'm 15 minutes from home, I can look at everything if. No, we don't want. We don't want you to drive anywhere. Would you just stay stationary? But if you don't recognize it, that's fine. Mr. Roach, could you go to the next page, please? And then if you go to the next page, you can go to the next page. Mr. Willman, do you recall ever responding to these questions? No. I mean, I really don't. I. You know, I have to say about my lawyer. You know, my lawyers and them. They, you know, when my work was comp. I mean, I'm not sure what they had going or what they'd done. You know, I turned everything over to them, so. Okay, well, I don't want you to tell me anything you discussed with them, but I just wanted to see if you recall responding to it. You can take that down, Mr. Mr. Roach. Mr. Roach, if you could put up plaintiffs exhibit number four. Do you recognize this photograph, Mr. Wilmoth? Oh, yeah, that's my truck. Is this the way the truck appeared after the wreck? Yes. You can take that down, Mr. Roach. Oh, I'm sorry. No. Before you take it down, go to the next page of that exhibit, page number two. Mr. Wilman, do you recognize this photograph? Yes, ma'. Am. I was taken out there. In the backyard at the Hamlin area. Is this the same truck that you were in on the. On June 18, 2021? Yes. And is this how the truck appeared after the wreck? Yes. And Mr. Roach, if you go to the next page of that exhibit, is this the same truck? Mr. Wilman? Yes. You recognize the photograph? Yes, ma'. Am. Mr. Roche, you can take down that exhibit. Mr. Roche, if you could put up plaintiffs exhibit number five. Do you recognize this vehicle in this photograph, Mr. Wilman? Not the photograph, but yes, the BMW. That's. I got a different picture of it. I didn't. I didn't receive that picture. Okay, but is this the BMW that was involved in the wreck with you? It looks like it, yes, ma'. Am. Like I said, I didn't receive that picture, but I do have a different picture. The pictures that you have, the pictures of the, that you have of this vehicle, who took those pictures? I believe my son did. And he provided those photographs to you? Yeah, my son, yes. And then those photographs that your son provided to you, did you give those to anybody at Hamlin Air? My workman's comp. And the people in the office seen them. All right, Mr. Roach, you can take that photograph down, please. Mr. Roach, if you could put up plaintiffs exhibit number six. Now, Mr. Willman, do you recognize this document? And Mr. Rose, if you can make the top of it a little bit bigger, it just looks like place part of the police report, Mr. And do you see your name, Jason Kelly Willman on the police report? Yes, ma'. Am. Over there on the left. And you see this is the date of June 18, 2021? Yes, ma'. Am. Miller, the Bay Chop. Yes, ma'. Am. And then you see that this, where this occurred, was Russell Parkway at the intersection of Tallulah Trail? Well, it wasn't Tallulah at Hazel. Tallulah's right past it. They're all three together, but it's Tallulah's probably 20 yards, 30 yards past Hazel. You just have to see, you know, you just have to go see the parking lot, the way, the way it's set up. You know, you just have to look at it. We were talking earlier about the police report, and you indicated that there were some inconsistencies or some errors on the police report. Was this the fact that it says at the intersection with Tallulah Trail? Is this one of the errors that you stated were on the police report when you saw that? That's one of them, yes. The errors that you saw in the police report, did you Contact any officer with the law enforcement agency to let them know of this errors. No, I told my. I told the lawyer and stuff about him. I told Hamlin about him, and I told the workings comp. Lawyer. Okay. Like I said, I don't want to know. I understand. I'm just, you know, you asked the question. I was just. I was just responding. Okay, but. So you did at least report it to Hamlin Air? Yes. But you did not report it to any law enforcement lawyer? No. What I'm. What I'm asking you, you did not report it to any law enforcement officer? No. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Roach, if you could go to the second page. And Mr. Wiltman, I know it's probably been a while since you've seen the police report, so I'm asking you to go off memory. But when you saw the police report, do you recall about how many pages were in the police report? I don't, but I. I still have a copy of it. I keep everything. I still have a copy of it. Like I said, I mean, I wished I was home. But you asked me a question, because I could pull it up right there at the house. You know, I can go in there and get it. I do apologize again, but this is the next. This is the next one that's described. CC shows her hit me from second lane. If she had hit me from the second lane, the car that was sitting right there, I would have hit. I was in the on pass, and she hit me from the turning lane and turned me into the second lane. If she had hit me right there, she had turned me into the first lane. But if you'll see where my truck's sitting at, it's in the second lane. Okay, Mr. Roche, if you can make that diagram a little bit bigger, please. See, if she'd have turned my truck when she hit me there, she'd have turned me. I'd have been in the first lane all the way to the right. If you look at where my truck's sitting, where that record was just picking it up, I'm in the second lane where she. Where she turned me into. Because she hit me from the turning lane. That's the second discrepancy I had on the police report. Okay, so you take issue with the diagram that's on the police report. Right. All right, Mr. Roach, you can take down plaintiffs exhibit number six, please. Okay, Mr. Willman, I am almost done. I just have a couple of more questions. Yes, ma'. Am. Do you know who wendy mccook is? Have you ever heard the name wendy mccook? No, ma'. Am. What about clay purser? No, ma'. Am. Not right of hand? No, ma'. Am. Okay. Mr. Wilman, are you presently married? No, ma'. Am. And for the record, what is your address? Your home address? 103 Sweet Gum Drive, Perry, Georgia. And how long have you lived in that residence? A little over two and about two and a half years. And I'm just going to ask you a couple of background questions. Where did you go to. Where did you go to high school? Warner Robins. Did you have any education after high school? No, ma'. Am. Did you have any training to become a foreman with Hamlin Air? No. I mean, nothing but hands on. I've just worked in H Vac for a long time. Did you go to any type of school to get certified as a H Vac worker? No, ma'. Am. How long did you work in that industry as an H Vac technician? Little over eight years. When you first started, were you a technician? Technician for H Vac? No, ma'. Am. You don't start out as a technician. No, ma'. Am. You start out as a labor and you work your way up.

I have a nephew who's in school right now to become an H Vac worker. So I totally get it. He can go anywhere as long as he just does a technician job. He can go anywhere, you know, because everybody needs everybody right now. Yeah. He lives in South Carolina, so. Yeah, I have a nephew doing that. Yeah. Tell him it's a hot job. Tell him not to expect just because he's H Vac technician, that he's been working the air conditioning. He gonna be in a hot part, you know, because the air conditioner's out.

Jason, the court reporter is going to type up the entire Transcript, all of Ms. Scott's questions and all of your answers. You have the right to read that transcript and confirm that it's correct by signing it. I think your answers were clear today. So you can waive that, right? So you don't have to do that if you want to. I'm fine with that. But if you feel strongly about reading it and signing it, we can do that as well. What would you like to do? Whichever. Whatever you. Whatever you feel like the best way to go here. Okay. We'll wait. That's fine. Okay. Thank you. I know. On the record. The court reporter. I want an e. Tran with the exhibits. And Mr. Rocha, I do want a copy of the video and I want it synced, please. Okay. And, Ms. Olsen, we're still on the record. Would you like any copies? Yes, I would like Etran with exhibits. I don't need a copy of the video right now. Okay. Very good. All right, then. This then now concludes the deposition. We'll go off the record at 3.16pm.",
