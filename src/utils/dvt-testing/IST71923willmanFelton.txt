              2                                   2:26 p.m.

              3             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  We are on the

              4        record.  Today's date is Wednesday, July 19, 2023,

              5        and the time right now is approximately 2:26 p.m.

              6        This will be the videotaped deposition of Jason

              7        Kelly Willman.  Will the court reporter go ahead

              8        and swear in the witness.

              9             THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes.  Could you please

             10        raise your right hand.  And I will administer the

             11        oath to you.

             12           (Whereupon, the Witness was duly sworn.)

             13             MS. SCOTT:  Good afternoon.  This will be the

             14        deposition of Jason Kelly Willman, taken by Counsel

             15        for the Plaintiff pursuant -- pursuant to notice

             16        and agreement of Counsel for the purposes of

             17        cross-examination of a witness, discovery, and all

             18        other purposes allowed under the Georgia Civil

             19        Practice Act.  I would ask that all objections

             20        except those going to the form of the question

             21        and/or the responsiveness of the witness' answer

             22        shall be reserved until the time of trial or some

             23        other use of the deposition transcript.  Counsel,

             24        is that agreeable?

             25             MS. OLSON:  That's agreeable.





                                                                           5


              1             MS. SCOTT:  Do you want to wait till the end

              2        to discuss signature with your client?

              3             MS. OLSON:  Yeah.  Just because we've had our

              4        little issues even getting him logged in, I'll wait

              5        till the end to make sure we don't have any

              6        technology blips that would necessitate a read and

              7        sign.

              8             MS. SCOTT:  All right.  Thank you.

              9   Whereupon,

             10                     JASON KELLY WILLMAN,

             11   was called as a deponent herein and, having first been

             12   duly sworn, was examined and deposed as follows:

             13                      CROSS-EXAMINATION

             14   BY MS. SCOTT:

             15        Q.   Mr. Willman, could you state and spell your

             16   first and last name for the record, please.

             17        A.   Jason Willman.  J-a-s-o-n; Willman,

             18   W-i-l-l-m-a-n.

             19        Q.   Thank you.  Mr. Willman, have you ever given a

             20   deposition before?

             21        A.   Yes, ma'am.

             22        Q.   Well, good.  So I'm just going to go over a

             23   couple of rules, however, just to refresh your memory on

             24   the rules of giving a deposition.

             25             We are giving this deposition via Zoom, which





                                                                           6


              1   means we are not in the same room.  There may be a delay

              2   in the time that I ask the question and you actually

              3   hear me.  So I ask that you let me give the question

              4   completely before you respond.  And I'll ask that you,

              5   when you give a response, you give a verbal response,

              6   saying yes or no, and then explain your response.  Is

              7   that agreeable?

              8        A.   Yes, ma'am.

              9        Q.   Now, are you under any medication that would

             10   impair your ability to answer my questions today?

             11        A.   No, ma'am.

             12        Q.   Okay.  And this deposition is not a marathon.

             13   So if at any time during the deposition you need to take

             14   a break, please just let me know.  But I would just ask

             15   that if I'm in the middle of a question or you're in the

             16   middle of a response that you give your response before

             17   taking that break.  Is that agreeable?

             18        A.   Yes, ma'am.

             19        Q.   Now, Mr. Willman, as stated, we're not in the

             20   same room.  Where are you located at this point in time?

             21        A.   Warner Robins, Georgia.

             22        Q.   And are you in your home?

             23        A.   No.  I'm at a friend's office.

             24        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.  Now, Mr. Willman, are you

             25   -- where are you presently employed?





                                                                           7


              1        A.   Nowhere at the moment.

              2        Q.   Do you remember the date -- I'm going to be

              3   asking some questions about June 18, 2021.  Do you

              4   remember that date?

              5        A.   Yes, ma'am.

              6        Q.   On June 18, 2021, who was your employer?

             10        Q.   And would the -- the complete name of the

             11   company be Hamlin Air Conditioning & Sheet Metal, Inc.?

             12        A.   Yes, ma'am.

             13        Q.   And what type of company is Hamlin?

             14        A.   Heat and air -- do commercial heating and air

             15   and ductwork.

             16        Q.   And just for the record, could you restate

             17   what your role was.

             18        A.   Working foreman.

             19        Q.   And what is a working foreman?

             20        A.   I oversee jobs and also do the work at the

             21   same time.

             22        Q.   On the date of June 18, 2021 -- when did you

             23   start working with Hamlin Air Conditioning?

             24        A.   On that morning?  6:30 --

             25        Q.   No.  I'm sorry.  Let me restate that question.





                                                                           8


              1             When did you start -- when did you become

              2   employed with Hamlin Air?

              3        A.   Probably five or six months before June 18.

              4        Q.   So somewhere around January 2021?

              5        A.   Yes, ma'am.  Close.  Could be right there,

              6   December, January.  You know, I just don't remember

              7   exactly.

              8        Q.   And you stated you are no longer working for

              9   Hamlin Air?

             10        A.   No, ma'am.

             11        Q.   Do you remember the date that you stopped

             12   working with Hamlin Air?

             13        A.   Well, the day of my accident.  And then, you

             14   know, I was on workmen's comp for almost two years.  So

             15   I don't remember exactly what day it stopped.  I could

             16   go back and look, but I'm not home.  But I can give them

             17   to Ms. Meg and let her -- let her know.

             18        Q.   Who was your previous employer before you

             19   started working with Hamlin Air?

             20        A.   Steele's Mechanical.

             21        Q.   And how long did you work for Steele [sic]

             22   Mechanical?

             23        A.   Couple of years.

             24             MS. SCOTT:  Okay.  Do we need to take a break?

             25        Is there someone in the room with you?





                                                                           9


              1             THE DEPONENT:  No.  My son walked in.  But I

              2        throwed him the truck keys.

              3             MS. SCOTT:  Okay.

              4             THE DEPONENT:  I apologize.  That's why I told

              5        him I'd be a few minutes.

              6             MS. SCOTT:  And so there's no one else in the

              7        room at this time?

              8             THE DEPONENT:  No, ma'am.

              9             MS. SCOTT:  Okay.  Thank you.

             10   BY MS. SCOTT:

             11        Q.   On June 18, 2021, where were you headed that

             12   day?

             13        A.   I was at lunch, and I was headed back to work

             14   on Robins Air Force Base.

             15        Q.   Can you describe in your own words how the

             16   the crash report that was documented incorrectly?

             17        A.   Yes, ma'am.

             18        Q.   Okay.  And we'll get to that in a minute.

             19             But to your recollection, if you remember

             20   offhand, what do you believe was documented incorrectly

             21   on the wreck -- regarding the wreck?

             22        A.   All right.  Well, the -- where they said that

             23   she hit me at -- she hit me from the turning lane.  They

             24   say she hit me from the second lane, and she hit me from

             25   the turning lane.





                                                                          19


              1        Q.   So are you saying that she was in the turning

              2   lane?

              3        A.   Yes, ma'am.

              4        Q.   Which direction was she turning, left or

              5   right?

              6        A.   She -- she would be turning left towards

              7   Tallulah.  But I'm not sure if, you know -- I'm not sure

              8   if she was turning that fast.  I mean, you know, if --

              9   there's just a bunch of contradiction as far as the

             10   police report right there at that moment.

             11        Q.   To your knowledge --

             12        A.   So that -- I'm sorry.

             13        Q.   I'm sorry.  Go ahead.

             14        A.   I -- I said I'm not --

             15        Q.   To your knowledge was --

             16        A.   You go --

             17        Q.   That's okay.  Go ahead.

             18        A.   I -- I'll wait on you.  Go ahead.  What was

             19   that?  I apologize.

             20        Q.   No.  You wanted to expound on your response.

             21   Go ahead.

             22        A.   Oh, I was just saying that, you know, if she

             23   was turning left, you know, she was turning fast.  You

             24   know, I mean, because she -- she turned me a hundred --

             25   110 degrees.  When she hit me, she turned me all the way





                                                                          20


              1   around into the road -- all the way into the lane, so .

              2   . .

              3             You know, everybody -- everybody was saying,

              4   you know, different things, you know.  But she hit me

              5   from the third lane, so -- and they're saying the second

              6   lane, and that -- that's not correct, you know.

              7        Q.   Were you responsible for any type of

              8   maintenance on the vehicle that you were driving?

              9        A.   No, ma'am.  Only thing I do is keep it clean.

             10   We have a shop --

             11        Q.   So you would --

             12        A.   There's a shop in -- a shop in Macon that does

             13   all the tires, brakes, all that -- all the maintenance,

             14   everything.  Only thing -- they change the oil and

             15   everything.  The only thing we do is keep the inside

             16   clean and the outside washed.

             17        Q.   Are you the one who would take it for any

             18   maintenance?

             19        A.   Yes, ma'am.  I would have to drop it off, you

             20   know.  I'd have to go get the oil changed.  I'd have to

             21   go -- everything.  And they had just given me the truck.

             22   We had brand-new tires on it, brand-new brakes on it,

             23   just had a fresh oil change, just painted.  I mean, it

             24   was -- you know, it was in real good shape.

             25        Q.   Prior to this wreck, had you been in any other





                                                                          21

              6   road.  Left the same restaurant.  On the same road at

              7   the other end of Russell Parkway on Corder Road.  Lady

              8   pulled out on Corder Road.  I T-boned her.

              9        Q.   Were you cited for that wreck?

             10        A.   No, ma'am.

             11        Q.   Was the other driver cited?

             12        A.   Yes, ma'am.

             13        Q.   Did you receive any type of discipline in

             15        A.   No, ma'am.  Right now, I mean, I just lost my

             16   job, you know, because of workmen's comp.

             17        Q.   You stated -- do you live in Bibb County?

             12        Q.   Do you recognize this photograph, Mr. Willman?

             13        A.   Oh, yeah.  That's my truck.

             14        Q.   Is this the way the truck appeared after the

             15   wreck?

             16        A.   Yes.

             17             MS. SCOTT:  You can take that down, Mr. Roach.

             18        I'm sorry, no.  Before you take that down, go to

             19        the next page of that exhibit, page number 2.

             23        A.   Yes, ma'am.  That was taken out there in the

             24   backyard at Hamlin Air.

             25        Q.   Is this the same truck that you were in on the

              1   -- on June 18, 2021?

              2        A.   Yes.

              3        Q.   And is this how the truck appeared after the

              4   wreck?

              5        A.   Yes.

              6             MS. SCOTT:  And, Mr. Roach, if you could go to

             23        Q.   Do you recognize this vehicle in this

             24   photograph, Mr. Willman?

             25        A.   Not that photograph.  But, yes, the -- the





                                                                          29


              1   BMW, that's -- I got a different picture of it.  I

              2   didn't -- I didn't receive that picture.

              3        Q.   Okay.  But is this the BMW that was involved

              4   in the wreck with you?

              5        A.   It looks like it.  Yes, ma'am.  I said, I

              6   didn't receive --

              7        Q.   Right.

              8        A.   -- that picture.  But I do have a different

              9   picture.

             10        Q.   The picture --

             11        A.   That appears --

             12        Q.   -- that you have -- the pictures that you have

             13   of this vehicle, who took those pictures?

             14        A.   I believe my son did.

             15        Q.   And he provided those photographs to you?

             16        A.   Yeah.  My son, yes.

             17        Q.   And then those photographs that your son

             18   provided to you, do you give those to anybody at Hamlin

             19   Air?

             20        A.   My workmen's comp and -- and the people in the

             21   office seen them.

             22             MS. SCOTT:  All right.  Mr. Roach, you can

              6        Q.   Now, Mr. Willman, do you recognize this

              8             MS. SCOTT:  And, Mr. Roach, if you can make

              9        the top of it --

             10             THE DEPONENT:  It's fine.

             11             MS. SCOTT:  -- a little bit bigger.

             12             THE DEPONENT:  It just looks like the police

             13        -- police report.

             14   BY MS. SCOTT:

             15        Q.   And do you see your name, Jason Kelly Willman,

             16   on the --

             17        A.   Yes, ma'am.

             18        Q.   -- police report?

             19        A.   Yes, ma'am.  Over there on the left.

             20        Q.   And you see this is the date of June 18, 2021?

             21        A.   Yes, ma'am.  Middle of the page, top.  Yes,

             22   ma'am.

             23        Q.   And then you see that this -- where this

             24   occurred was Russell Parkway at the intersection of

             25   Tallulah Trail?





                                                                          31


              1        A.   It wasn't Tallulah.  It's at Hazel.

              2   Tallulah's right past it.  They're all three together

              3   right -- Tallulah is probably 20 yards, 30 yards past

              4   Hazel.

              5        Q.   Okay.

              6        A.   You would just have to see, you know.  You

              7   would just have to go see the parking lot.  The way --

              8   the way it's set up, you know, you'd just have to look

              9   at it.

             10        Q.   We were talking earlier about the police

             11   report, and you indicated that there were some

             12   inconsistencies or some errors on the police report.

             13        A.   Yes.

             14        Q.   Was this -- the fact that it says at the

             15   intersection with Tallulah Trail, is this one of the

             16   errors that you stated were on the police report --

             17        A.   Yes.  That's one --

             18        Q.   -- when you saw it?

             19        A.   That's one of them.  Yes.

             20        Q.   The errors that you saw on the police report,

             21   did you contact any officer with the law enforcement

             22   agency to let them know of the errors?

             23        A.   No.  I -- I told my -- I told the lawyer and

             24   stuff about them.  I told Hamlin about them.  And I told

             25   the workmen's comp lawyer.





                                                                          32


              1        Q.   Okay.  Like I said, I don't want to know if --

              2        A.   I know.  I know.  I understand.  I'm just --

              3        Q.   Okay.

              4        A.   You know, you asked the question, and I was

              5   just -- I was just responding.

              6        Q.   Okay.  So you did at least report it to Hamlin

              7   Air?

              8        A.   Yes.

              9        Q.   But you did not report it to any law

             10   enforcement?

             11        A.   Lawyer.  My workmen's comp lawyer.

             12        Q.   No.  What I'm -- what I'm asking you:  You did

             13   not report it to any law enforcement officer?

             14        A.   No.

             15        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

             16             MS. SCOTT:  Mr. Roach, if you could go to the

             17        second page.

             18             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  (Complies.)

             19   BY MS. SCOTT:

             20        Q.   And, Mr. Willman, I know it's probably been a

             21   while since you've seen the police report, so I'm asking

             22   you to go off memory.

             23             When you saw the police report, do you recall

             24   about how many pages were in the police report?

             25        A.   I don't.  But I -- I still have a copy of it.





                                                                          33


              1   I keep everything.  I still have a copy of it, like I

              2   said.  I mean, I wished I was home with you asking the

              3   question because I could put it up right there at the

              4   house, and I could go in there and get that.  I do

              5   apologize again.  But this the -- this is the --

              6        Q.   That's okay.

              7        A.   This is the next one that's the discrepancy.

              8   See, it shows her hitting me from the second lane.  If

              9   she'd have hit me from the second lane, the car that was

             10   sitting right there, I would've hit.  I was in the -- on

             11   past and she hit me from the turning lane and turned me

             12   into the second lane.

             13             If she'd have hit me right there, she'd have

             14   turned me into the first lane.  But if you'll see where

             15   my truck's sitting at, it's in the second lane.

             16             MS. SCOTT:  Okay.  Mr. Roach, if you could

             17        make that diagram a little bit bigger, please.

             18             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  (Complies.)

             19             THE DEPONENT:  See, if she'd have turned my

             20        truck -- when she hit me there, if she'd have

             21        turned me, I'd have been in the first lane all the

             22        way to the right.  If you look at where my truck's

             23        sitting, where that wrecker was just picking it up,

             24        I'm in the second lane where she -- where she

             25        turned me into.  Because she hit from the turning





                                                                          34


              1        lane.  That's the second discrepancy I had on the

              2        police report.

              3   BY MS. SCOTT:

              4        Q.   Okay.  So you take issue with the diagram

              5   that's on the police report?

              6        A.   Right.

              7             MS. SCOTT:  All right.  Mr. Roach, you can

              8        take down Plaintiff's Exhibit Number 6, please.

              9             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  (Complies.)

             10             MS. SCOTT:  Okay.  Mr. Willman, I am almost

             11        done.  I just have a couple of more questions.

             12             THE DEPONENT:  Yes, ma'am.

             13   BY MS. SCOTT:

             14        Q.   Do you know who Wendy McCook is?  Have you

             15   ever heard of the name Wendy McCook?

             16        A.   No, ma'am.

             17        Q.   What about Clay Purser?

             18        A.   No, ma'am.  Not right offhand.  No, ma'am.

             19        Q.   Okay.  Mr. Willman, are you presently married?

             20        A.   No, ma'am.

             21        Q.   And for the record, what is your address --

             22   your home address?

             23        A.   103 Sweetgum Drive, Perry, Georgia.

             24        Q.   And how long have you lived in that residence?

             25        A.   Been over two -- about two and a half years.





                                                                          35


              1        Q.   And I'm just going to ask you a couple of

              2   background questions.  Where did you go to -- where did

              3   you go to high school?

              4        A.   Warner Robins.

              5        Q.   Did you have any education after high school?

              6        A.   No, ma'am.

              7        Q.   Did you have any training to become a foreman

              8   with Hamlin Air?

              9        A.   No.  I mean, nothing but hands-on.  I -- I've

             10   just worked in HVAC for a long time.

             11        Q.   Did you go to any type of school to get

             12   certified as an HVAC worker?

             13        A.   No, ma'am.

             14        Q.   How long were -- did you work in that industry

             15   as an HVAC technician?

             16        A.   Little over eight years.

             17        Q.   When you first started, were you a technician

             18   -- technician for HVAC?

             19        A.   No, ma'am.  You don't start out as a

             20   technician.  No, ma'am.  Start out as a laborer and you

             21   work your way up.

             22        Q.   Okay.

             23        A.   I started from the bottom --

             24        Q.   That's exactly what I want to know.

             25        A.   Yes, ma'am.  I started --





                                                                          36


              1        Q.   That's what I want to know.

              2        A.   I started toting boxes and screws for a long

              3   time and then worked my way up.

              4        Q.   Okay.  I have a nephew who's in school right

              5   now to become an HVAC worker.  So I totally get it.

              6        A.   He can -- he can go anywhere as long -- long

              7   as he just does the technician job, he can go anywhere.

              8   You know, because everybody needs everybody right now.

              9        Q.   Yeah.  He lives in South Carolina.  So, yep, I

             10   have a nephew doing that.

             11        A.   Yeah.  It's a hot job --

             12        Q.   And so you as --

             13        A.   Tell him it's a hot job.  Tell him not to

             14   expect just because he's an HVAC technician that he's

             15   fixing to work in the air conditioning.  He's going to

             16   be in the hot part, you know, because the air

             17   conditioning's out.  So just tell him good luck.

             18        Q.   I will let him know.

             19             And, Mr. Willman, so you advanced from a

             20   laborer all the way up to foreman?

             21        A.   Yes, ma'am.

             22        Q.   And are -- you're presently divorced?

             23        A.   Yes, ma'am.  Been divorced for a long time.

             24        Q.   And does your wife -- does your former wife

             25   live in Bibb County?

              1        A.   No.

              2             MS. SCOTT:  Okay.  Mr. Willman, I have looked

              3        over my notes.  I believe those are all the

              4        questions I have for you today.

              5             THE DEPONENT:  Okay.

              6             MS. SCOTT:  I don't have any additional

              7        questions.

              8             THE DEPONENT:  Okay.

              9             MS. OLSON:  I do not have any questions.

             10             Jason, the court reporter is going to type up

             11        the entire transcript, all of Ms. Scott's questions

             12        and all of your answers.

             13             THE DEPONENT:  Okay.

             14             MS. OLSON:  You have a right to read that

             15        transcript and confirm that it's correct by signing

             16        it.  I think your answers were clear today, so you

             17        can waive that right.  So you don't have to do

             18        that.  If you want to, I'm fine with that.  But if

             19        you feel strongly about reading it and signing it,

             20        we can do that as well.  What would you like to do?

             21             THE DEPONENT:  Whichever -- whatever you --

             22        whatever you feel like the best way to go is.

             23             MS. OLSON:  Okay.  We'll waive.  That's fine.

             24             MS. SCOTT:  Okay.  Thank you.

             25             THE DEPONENT:  Yes, ma'am.

              1             MS. SCOTT:  I want an etran with the exhibits.

              2             And, Mr. Roach, I do want a copy of the video,

              3        and I want it synced, please.

              4             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  And, Ms. Olson,

              5        we're still on the record.  Would you like any

              6        copies?

              7             MS. OLSON:  Yes.  I would like etran with

              8        exhibits.  I don't need a copy of the video right

              9        now.

             10             THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Very good.  All

             11        right.  Then this then now concludes the

             12        deposition.  We'll go off the record at 3:16 p.m.
