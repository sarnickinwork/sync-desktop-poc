 2                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS,

 3                 having been first duly sworn,

 4             was examined and testified as follows:

 5  

 6                          EXAMINATION

 7  BY MR. TUENGE:    

 8      Q.  Will you please state your full name.  

 9      A.  Christopher Donald Ricketts.  

10      Q.  Mr. Ricketts, we were introduced just a minute ago 

11  off the record, but now that we're on the record and I'll be 

12  asking you questions, I'll introduce myself to you directly.  

13  My name in Peter Tuenge, and for our purposes today, I 

14  represent Sky Lakes and Dr. Peters and Dr. Smith in a 

15  lawsuit that you and your wife have filed against them.  

16          Do you understand that's who I am and that's my role 

17  today?  

18      A.  I do.  

19      Q.  Today is the day that we've scheduled for you and 

20  your wife to give deposition, today, as it relates to the 

21  events of the lawsuit.  

22          Are you prepared do that?  

23      A.  Yes, I am.  

24      Q.  Have you given deposition testimony like this in any 

25  circumstance before today?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                      7

 1      A.  No, I have not.  

 2      Q.  I'll go through a few general guidelines that should 

 3  help us through the process --  

 4      A.  Okay.  

 5      Q.  -- today.  These may be things you've heard from 

 6  your attorney, but they should help us through the process.  

 7  We have a court reporter sitting between us.  It is her job 

 8  to type down each of the questions that are asked and each 

 9  of your answers.  

10          Because of that, we need to do a couple things.  

11  First, we need to make sure that we're not talking at the 

12  same time, because the reporter can't type two people 

13  talking at the same time.  

14          So will you please make an effort to let me finish 

15  my question before you start your answer?  

16      A.  Yes, sir.  

17      Q.  Okay.  I appreciate that, and I'll do the same, let 

18  you finish your answer before I start my question.  The next 

19  thing is I need you to answer all of my questions out loud, 

20  with words, as opposed to physical movements and gestures, 

21  so that your court reporter can get down an accurate 

22  transcript.  

23          Will you do your best to do that?  

24      A.  Yes, sir.  

25      Q.  As we go along, I may follow up with you and ask you 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                      8

 1  if that's a "yes" or "no."  I'm not doing that to be rude to 

 2  you.  I'm doing that to make sure we have a good clean 

 3  record for the court reporter.  Okay?  

 4      A.  Yes, sir.  

 5      Q.  I'm also going to need to have you keep your voice 

 6  up, so that I can hear you, and the court reporter can hear 

 7  you, so that she can type down all the answers accurately.  

 8          Fair enough?  

 9      A.  Yes, sir.  

10      Q.  As we go along, I want to make sure that you and I 

11  are communicating with each other, and in order to do that, 

12  I need to make sure that you understand each of my questions 

13  before you answer them; so if I ask you a question and, for 

14  any reason, you need me to clarify it or ask in a different 

15  way to make sure you understood it, will you please speak up 

16  and let me know that?  

17      A.  Yes, sir.  

18      Q.  I can assure you I won't be asking you any trick 

19  questions at all today.  So if you have any issue with one 

20  of my questions or you need me to rephrase it, to just make 

21  sure you understand it, say that, and I'll rephrase any 

22  question to make sure you understood it.  

23          Fair enough?  

24      A.  Yes, sir.  

25      Q.  You can take a break this morning at any time for 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                      9

 1  any reason.  The only caveat is that, if I ask you a 

 2  question, you need to answer that question, and then let us 

 3  know you need to take a break, and we can take a break.  

 4  Okay?  

 5      A.  Yes, sir.  

 6      Q.  You can take a break for any reason.  You can take 

 7  any number of breaks.  Just simply tell me you need a break, 

 8  and we'll take a break.  

 9          Fair enough?  

10      A.  Fair enough.  

11      Q.  All right.  Did you review any documents or items to 

12  help get ready for your deposition testimony today?  

13      A.  No, I did not.  

14      Q.  All right.  Other than the lawsuit that brings us 

15  together today, have you been a party to any other lawsuit?  

16      A.  No, I have not.  

17      Q.  So this is the first time you've brought a suit 

18  against anybody; correct?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  And you yourself have never been sued?  

21      A.  Yeah.  I've never been sued.  

22      Q.  All right.  And no offense by this question.  I ask 

23  everybody this question.  

24          Have you ever been convicted of a crime?  

25      A.  Yes.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     10

 1      Q.  How many?  

 2      A.  I have DUIs.  

 3      Q.  More than one?  

 4      A.  Yes.  I've got -- I believe two -- my last one was 

 5  in 2004.  

 6      Q.  Okay.  So the last one was in 2004.  

 7          Do you happen to remember when the one prior to that 

 8  was?  

 9      A.  I don't.  It was previous to 2004 as well.  

10      Q.  All right.  And no -- no convictions, no crimes 

11  since 2004?  

12      A.  No.  I was charged in an Assault II.  

13      Q.  Okay.  When were you charged with Assault II?  

14      A.  I was convicted in, I believe, October of 2019 -- or 

15  2009.  Excuse me.  I'm sorry.  2009.  

16      Q.  Were the DUIs in Klamath County?  

17      A.  Yes.  

18      Q.  How about the Assault II?  

19      A.  Yes.  

20      Q.  Any other crimes?  

21      A.  No.  Other than like traffic violations or things 

22  like that but -- 

23      Q.  No.  No criminal charges or convictions since 2009?  

24      A.  No, no.  

25      Q.  All right.  I'm going to ask you lots of questions 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     11

 1  about your interactions with my clients, Dr. Peters and 

 2  Dr. Smith, but before we get there, I want to ask you a 

 3  broad question.  

 4          During any of your interactions with them, did you 

 5  make any recordings of those events?  

 6      A.  Prior?  Is that what you said?  

 7      Q.  No.  So during any of your interactions with them -- 

 8  so at their office or wherever -- when you were with them, 

 9  communicating with them, did you ever make any recordings of 

10  those communications?  

11      A.  Not like video recordings or anything like that, no.  

12      Q.  And I'm thinking of sometimes people can record 

13  audio on an iPhone or record things on video -- anything 

14  like that.  

15          Did you make any recordings of any of the things 

16  they told you or communicated to you?  

17      A.  Just text messages with Dr. Peters' cell phone.  

18      Q.  Got it.  Okay.  And I've seen many of those.  

19      A.  Yes.  

20      Q.  Have you provided all of the text messages you had 

21  with Dr. Peters and his cell phone to your attorney?  

22      A.  Yes, I have.  

23      Q.  And I didn't see any text message communications 

24  with Dr. Smith.  

25          Do you have any communications like that?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     12

 1      A.  I don't.  

 2      Q.  Did you ever speak with Dr. Smith on Dr. Smith's 

 3  personal or cell phone?  

 4      A.  No.  

 5      Q.  Okay.  So, I want to learn a little bit about your 

 6  background before we get into the medical events.  

 7          What's your date of birth?  

 8      A.  March 4, 1983.  

 9      Q.  Where were you born?  

10      A.  San Bernardino County, California.  

11      Q.  Did you grow up in San Bernardino County?  

12      A.  No.  When I was real young at ages I don't remember, 

13  we lived down there, but then my earliest memory is 

14  North Plains outside of, like, Forest Grove in Oregon, and 

15  then moved here to Klamath Falls.  

16      Q.  How old were you when you moved to Klamath Falls?  

17      A.  I went to kindergarten at Fairview Elementary so -- 

18      Q.  And have you lived here in the Klamath Falls area 

19  from kindergarten up to the present?  

20      A.  I left for a little while.  I believe it was about 

21  seventh grade.  Me and my family moved to Portland and lived 

22  in Tigard, and I went to Tigard High School.

23      Q.  So, from seventh grade -- and did you complete high 

24  school at Tigard High School?  

25      A.  No.  I finished my freshman year, and then my 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     13

 1  sophomore year, I ended up getting two full-time jobs to 

 2  help my family, and I was just -- pretty much quit high 

 3  school to work.  

 4      Q.  When you got the two jobs to help your family, as 

 5  what would have been your sophomore year --  

 6      A.  Yes.  

 7      Q.  -- was that in the Tigard area?  

 8      A.  Yes.  

 9      Q.  How long did you live in the Tigard area before you 

10  moved back to Klamath?  

11      A.  I would say -- 7th, 8th, 9th -- probably about four 

12  years.  

13      Q.  And, then, have you lived here in the Klamath Falls 

14  area since coming back?  

15      A.  Yes.  

16      Q.  What was the last year of high school you completed?  

17      A.  I completed my freshman year.  

18      Q.  Got it.  And that was at Tigard High School?  

19      A.  Yes.  

20      Q.  You dropped out of high school at that point?  

21      A.  In my sophomore year yes.  

22      Q.  Did you complete a GED?  

23      A.  Yes.  

24      Q.  When did you do that?  

25      A.  I believe it was two thousand either '10 or '11.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     14

 1      Q.  Have you gone on to have any formal education since 

 2  completing your GED?  

 3      A.  No, I have not.  

 4      Q.  No community college or anything like that?  

 5      A.  No.  

 6      Q.  Do you remember approximately what year it was that 

 7  you came back to Klamath Falls from Tigard?  

 8      A.  I want to say -- I know I came back and started 

 9  fighting wildland fires for Jim Hogue at Nor-Cal Fire 

10  Suppression.  So I was probably 18, 19 years old.  

11      Q.  And if my math is good, which is not very often, 

12  you're 42 now?  

13      A.  Yes.  

14      Q.  So you've been here in Klamath Falls since 

15  approximately 18 until now?  

16      A.  Yeah.  

17      Q.  So can you, sort of, walk me through your work 

18  history since you came back to Klamath Falls.  

19          You said you were fighting wildland fires?  

20      A.  Yes.  

21      Q.  Can you, sort of, walk me through from that time 

22  forward what you've done for work.  

23      A.  I've done steel framing, acoustical ceilings, 

24  drywall -- pretty much any trade of construction.  It wasn't 

25  up until recently, when I got hired at Rocky Mountain, did I 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     15

 1  actually get on heavy equipment and stuff, but, usually, 

 2  it's just been framing, steel framing, pole barns -- things 

 3  like that.  

 4      Q.  So it sounds like a lot of different jobs in the 

 5  construction field?  

 6      A.  Yeah.  Throughout my years of growing up, yes.  

 7      Q.  Okay.  Have you had any jobs, outside of the home, 

 8  other than the wildland firefighting and your work in the 

 9  construction field?  

10      A.  No.  

11      Q.  All right.  And I'm going to go through your work in 

12  a bit more detail in a minute.  Let's talk about your family 

13  life.  

14          Do I understand that you're married?  

15      A.  Yes.  

16      Q.  And your wife is Nichole, who is here in the room 

17  today; correct?  

18      A.  Correct.  

19      Q.  When did the two of you marry?  

20      A.  January 7, 2015 -- '16.  It was '16.  I know I asked 

21  her out the -- '15 and then married here on the '16, so it 

22  was one year to the day I asked her out so -- 

23      Q.  Good.  And you two have been married from that time 

24  until the present?  

25      A.  Correct.

 1      Q.  Have you had any periods of formal legal separation?  

 2      A.  No, not at all.  

 3      Q.  And, of course, no divorce?  

 4      A.  No.  

 5      Q.  Was your marriage to Ms. Ricketts your first 

 6  marriage?  

 7      A.  Yes.  

 8      Q.  How about for her?  Had she been previously married?  

 9      A.  No, she has not.  

10      Q.  So it's your first marriage for both of you?  

11      A.  Yes.  

12      Q.  Let's talk about children.  I believe I understand 

13  that you have a prior child before your relationship with 

14  Ms. Ricketts; is that right?  

15      A.  Yes, I do.  

16      Q.  Okay.  And what is that child's name?  

17      A.  Madison Ricketts.  

18      Q.  And Madison is a girl?  

19      A.  Yes.  

20      Q.  What is her date of birth?  

21      A.  It is 6/14/2005.

 1      Q.  What does she do for work?  

 2      A.  She does -- as far as I know, she's still selling 

 3  plants and things like that, so she was working at a 

 4  sandwich shop for a little while there.  

 5      Q.  Is she married?  

 6      A.  No, she's not.  

 7      Q.  Has she ever been married?  

 8      A.  No.  

 9      Q.  Does she have any children?  

10      A.  No.  

11      Q.  Do you maintain a relationship with her?  

12      A.  Not -- mainly just like birthdays and things like 

13  that, I'll send her money and stuff, but I don't -- I don't 

14  see her all the time.  I don't talk to her all the time.  

15      Q.  Okay.  So sounds like you have some relationship, 

16  but it's not necessarily very close.  

17          Would that be accurate?  

18      A.  Yes.  

19      Q.  All right.  And then tell me about your other 

20  children, please, names and date of birth.  

21      A.  My princess is Hunter Ricketts, and her date of 

22  birth is 3/13/2019.  And then my son Christopher Donald 

23  Ricketts II; his date of birth is December 3, 2015.  

24      Q.  Both of those children are with your wife, Nichole?  

25      A.  Yes.

 9      Q.  Is that a house?  

10      A.  Yes.  

11      Q.  Is that a house you own on a mortgage?  

12      A.  Yes.

15  or '17.  

16      Q.  Do you have any current plans to move?  

17      A.  No.  

18      Q.  Do your children live with you at that house?  

19      A.  Yes.  

20      Q.  And, of course, your wife does as well; correct?  

21      A.  Yes.

23  house?  

24      A.  No.  

25      Q.  Have you lived at that house since you bought it in, 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     19

 1  approximately, 2016 up until the present?  

 2      A.  Correct.  

 3      Q.  Does your wife, Nichole, work outside of the home?  

 4      A.  Yes, she does.  

 5      Q.  What does she do?  

 6      A.  She's a ParaPro at Shasta Elementary School.  

 7      Q.  Tell me what a ParaPro is.  

 8      A.  They help line the kids up for the buses and get 

 9  them ready for going into the school.  She helps with 

10  testing, helps with kids with disabilities and things like 

11  that.  

12      Q.  Is that full-time work for her?  

13      A.  Yes, it is.  

14      Q.  Is that work just during the school year?  

15      A.  Yes.  

16      Q.  So she has her summers off?  

17      A.  Yes.  

18      Q.  Does she work outside of the home during summers?  

19      A.  No.  

20      Q.  And by full-time, does that mean she works, 

21  approximately, 40 hours a week during the school year?  

22      A.  I believe it's 32 to 40.  I'm not exactly sure, 

23  because they get holidays off, and she works the school 

24  hours.  

25      Q.  How long has she been doing that work?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     20

 1      A.  This is her first year.  I believe she started in 

 2  September of just this last year.  

 3      Q.  Was she working outside of the home before that?  

 4      A.  Yeah.  She was doing real estate.  

 5      Q.  In what capacity?  What was her job?  

 6      A.  I don't know how to describe it.  She would show 

 7  houses and write up paperwork and -- a realtor, I would say.  

 8      Q.  She was a real estate agent?  

 9      A.  A real estate agent, yes.  

10      Q.  Did she work for a company, or was that work she did 

11  for herself?  

12      A.  She worked for a company called Fisher Nicholson and 

13  then eXp Realty.  

14      Q.  Selling residential homes?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  How long did she do that work?  

17      A.  I -- I would say a few years.  I mean, I can't be 

18  exactly sure, but I know she did it -- she didn't like 

19  talking to the people as much.  She would like more the 

20  paperwork side, so -- but --  

21      Q.  Okay.  Why did she transition from real estate to 

22  her current role as a ParaProfessional at the school?  

23      A.  Because she was a stay-at-home mother, raising my 

24  children, and I took care of all of -- everything.  She took 

25  care of the house and the kids.  Well, when she realized 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     21

 1  that the kids are going to be starting school, our youngest 

 2  is going to be going to kindergarten, she wanted to make 

 3  sure that, you know, she was around our kids still.  

 4          So she followed them to the school and got a job 

 5  there.  I mean, she donated all of her time there.  She was, 

 6  like, in, like, the Boosters programs and any kind of 

 7  raising money.  My wife was totally involved with all of it; 

 8  so she wanted to -- everybody at the school loved her.  

 9  Like, "Why don't you just get a job here?  Hunter is going 

10  to start school this year."  

11          So she's like, "All right," and as far as I know, 

12  she loves it so -- yeah.  

13      Q.  It sounds like, as far as you're aware, she doesn't 

14  have any current plans to change her job?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  Other than your two children and your wife, do you 

17  have any other family members here in Klamath Falls?  

18      A.  I have a stepson.  

19      Q.  Okay.  What is his name?  

20      A.  Nathan Onder.  

21      Q.  Can you spell the last name for me.  

22      A.  O-n-d-e-r.  

23      Q.  Approximately how old is Nathan?  

24      A.  I believe he's getting to be 25 now.  I believe he 

25  was born in 2005.

 2      A.  Yes.  

 3      Q.  Does he work outside of the home?  

 4      A.  Yes.  

 5      Q.  What type of work does he is do?  

 6      A.  The DHS office.  

 7      Q.  What does he do for DHS?  

 8      A.  I believe he's a case manager or case worker.  

 9      Q.  And that's Ms. Ricketts' son from a prior 

10  relationship?  

11      A.  That's my wife, Nichole's, son from a -- yeah.  

12      Q.  Got it.  Do you have a relationship with Mr. Onder?  

13      A.  Yes, I do.  

14      Q.  Any other family members, here, in the Klamath Falls 

15  area?  

16      A.  Yes.  

17      Q.  Who else?  

18      A.  Grandmother, mother, aunt and cousins, and uncle and 

19  his family.  I have some family here, yes.  

20      Q.  So your mother is still living?  

21      A.  Yes.  

22      Q.  What's her name?  

23      A.  Sara.  

24      Q.  Last name?  

25      A.  Graham.

 1      Q.  Do you have any family members that work in the 

 2  medical field?  

 3      A.  No.  

 4      Q.  To your knowledge, have any of your family members 

 5  been a patient of Dr. Matthew Peters?  

 6      A.  No.  

 7      Q.  How about Dr. Dwight Smith?  

 8      A.  No.  

 9      Q.  And I imagine, over the course of time, the years 

10  they have lived here, they probably have been patients up at 

11  Sky Lakes from time to time?  

12      A.  Yeah.  I believe most of, like, my cousins and 

13  everything were all born up there; so my kids were born up 

14  there.  

15      Q.  Got it.  So, let's talk a little bit about your 

16  medical care and health history.  

17      A.  Okay.  

18      Q.  So, I see, in some of the records that we have on 

19  the case, that you developed some low-back pain years ago, I 

20  think, back in 2009, maybe, following a motor vehicle 

21  accident?  

22      A.  Yes.  

23      Q.  Can you tell me about the motor vehicle accident.  

24      A.  That I was in a rollover in a vehicle.  

25      Q.  Was that here in the Klamath Falls area?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     24

 1      A.  I believe it was outside Tulelake, but, yeah, 

 2  Klamath Falls area.  

 3      Q.  Okay.  So you had a rollover accident, and did you 

 4  receive medical care following that accident immediately?  

 5      A.  Yes.  

 6      Q.  Did you suffer an injury to your back from that 

 7  accident?  

 8      A.  Yes, I did.  

 9      Q.  What was the injury?  

10      A.  I believe it was a crushed L1, L2, L3, and 5 disks 

11  in my back.  

12      Q.  Do you happen to recall the disks?  

13      A.  I don't.  

14      Q.  Were they lumbar?  

15      A.  I believe so.  

16      Q.  Did you receive care at Sky Lakes Medical Center for 

17  that?  

18      A.  Yes.  Yes, I did.  

19      Q.  Were you -- 

20      A.  And -- 

21      Q.  Go ahead.  

22      A.  They ran me through the tube, and then they took me 

23  to St. Charles Hospital for further care.  

24      Q.  All right.  So you had your initial work-up and 

25  imaging here, and then you were transferred up to 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     25

 1  St. Charles in Bend?  

 2      A.  Correct.  

 3      Q.  Did you undergo surgery at St. Charles?  

 4      A.  Yes, I did.  

 5      Q.  What surgery did you have?  

 6      A.  I had a spinal fusion.  

 7      Q.  That was a spinal fusion in your lumbar spine?  

 8      A.  Yes.  I believe L1, L2, and L3.  

 9      Q.  Any other surgical care that you had at that time at 

10  St. Charles?  

11      A.  No.  

12      Q.  How long were you hospitalized at St. Charles before 

13  you were discharged?  

14      A.  I believe a week.  

15      Q.  Had you had surgery of any kind before you had that 

16  back surgery in 2009?  

17      A.  No.  

18      Q.  That was your first surgery?  

19      A.  Yes.  I've had stitches, but no surgeries.  

20      Q.  Okay.  And had you had any surgeries, from the time 

21  you had your fusion in 2009 up to the vasectomy that brings 

22  us here, together, in this lawsuit?  

23      A.  No.  

24      Q.  No other surgeries?  

25      A.  No.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     26

 1      Q.  Okay.  All right.  To your perspective, was the 

 2  lumbar fusion that you had in 2009 a successful surgery for 

 3  you?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  Okay.  

 6      A.  Yes.  

 7      Q.  When you came out of that surgery and you went 

 8  through the period of time that it takes to recover from 

 9  that surgery, did you have any lasting symptoms at all from 

10  your back injury at that time?  

11      A.  No, no.  

12      Q.  Have you gone on to have any back surgeries since 

13  your fusion?  

14      A.  No, not at all.  

15      Q.  And I take it, then, that you still have the fusion 

16  hardware in your lumbar spine that was placed in 2009?  

17      A.  Correct.  

18      Q.  Do you have to go back and see a surgeon and have 

19  imaging to look at that hardware from time to time?  

20      A.  No.  

21      Q.  Were you placed on any sort of activity 

22  restrictions, after you recovered from surgery, just based 

23  on the fact that you had that lumbar fusion?  

24      A.  There was a point in time where Dr. Ward had asked 

25  me to no bending, lifting, and twisting for, like, three 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     27

 1  months.  He didn't want me lifting anything heavy or bending 

 2  or twisting until I got my core strength back.  

 3      Q.  And Dr. Ward was the surgeon who performed the 

 4  surgery?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  Following that, approximately, three-month time 

 7  period, did Dr. Ward put any sort of restriction on your 

 8  activities based on the fusion?  

 9      A.  Nope.  

10      Q.  Did you find that the fusion limited your abilities 

11  in any way, after you recovered, about three months 

12  following the surgery?  

13      A.  No.  

14      Q.  Did you lose any range of motion or anything like 

15  that?  

16      A.  I do notice that, like, if I have to bend over and 

17  work, I do a lot better if I kneel down onto my knee, like 

18  knee pads.  

19      Q.  And that's something that you noticed since you had 

20  the fusion?  

21      A.  Uh-huh.  

22      Q.  Is that a "yes"?  

23      A.  Yes.  

24      Q.  All right.  

25          MR. LINTHORST:  Is this a good time for a break,

 8  is 9:36.  

 9      Q.  BY MR. TUENGE:  We just took a break.  

10          Are you okay to continue?  

11      A.  Yes, I am.  

12      Q.  All right.  Who is your current primary care 

13  provider?  

14      A.  Erin Gonzales.  

15      Q.  How long has Dr. Gonzales been your primary care 

16  provider?  

17      A.  I'm not 100 percent sure on the amount of years, but 

18  for -- she's been there -- I don't know -- five years or 

19  more.  

20      Q.  Okay.  Who was your primary care provider before 

21  Dr. Gonzales?  

22      A.  I can't really -- I can't really remember.  

23      Q.  Do you remember a clinic or a location where you 

24  were going before you became a patient of Dr. Gonzales?  

25      A.  I can't.  I don't think I was very -- I don't -- 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     29

 1  yeah, I don't remember any certain doctor that I'd see.  

 2  Usually, it would be just, like, emergency room, if I had 

 3  stitches or something so -- 

 4      Q.  It sounds like, before Dr. Gonzales, you would go in 

 5  and seek care, if you had an issue, but you weren't 

 6  necessarily going in on a regular basis?  

 7      A.  Sure, yeah.  

 8      Q.  Once you established with Dr. Gonzales, you see her 

 9  on more of a regular basis and as-needed?  Would that be 

10  correct to say?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  So I have some records from Dr. Gonzales back in 

13  2021, talking about a few things.  She talked about a 

14  history that you had of a facial fracture from fighting.  

15          Did you have a facial fracture?  

16      A.  I was assaulted, yes.  

17      Q.  When was that?  

18      A.  I can't remember the date.  I know it was in the 

19  early 2000s.  

20      Q.  Was that here in Klamath?  

21      A.  Yes.  

22      Q.  Okay.  All right.  And it sounds like you were found 

23  to have had some sort of a fracture in your face from that 

24  assault?  

25      A.  Correct.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     30

 1      Q.  Do you recall where the fracture was?  

 2      A.  They were on both sides of my cheekbones right here.  

 3  That's why I have a deviated septum.  

 4      Q.  Did you receive any surgical care for those 

 5  fractures?  

 6      A.  I did not.  

 7      Q.  So you didn't have any plates or any screws or 

 8  anything like that placed?  

 9      A.  I did not.  

10      Q.  Did you receive any other care from those fractures, 

11  other than having them diagnosed?  

12      A.  No.  

13      Q.  Have you had any other facial trauma?  

14      A.  No.  

15      Q.  Okay.  Dr. Gonzales also makes reference, in 2021, 

16  to you having sciatica associated with your lumbar spine.  

17          Do you know what sciatica is?  

18      A.  I believe that's a nerve that runs down your lower 

19  back, yeah.  

20      Q.  Yeah.  Oftentimes, patients that complain of 

21  sciatica complain of pain that radiates down in their legs?  

22      A.  Uh-huh, yes.  

23      Q.  Do you recall having symptoms of sciatica since your 

24  spinal fusion?  

25      A.  Correct.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     31

 1      Q.  Tell me about that.  When did you first start 

 2  experiencing sciatica?  

 3      A.  It was an isolated incident where I was lifting a 

 4  rock into the back of my truck.  

 5      Q.  What did you feel?  

 6      A.  I felt tingling throughout my lower back and down 

 7  into my legs.  

 8      Q.  Was that into both legs?  

 9      A.  I believe so.  

10      Q.  Did it go down to your feet?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  Did you receive any medical care for that?  

13      A.  No, I did not.  I just went and seen Erin Gonzales, 

14  and she took an X ray of my back.  

15      Q.  What did she tell you about the X ray?  

16      A.  She believes I compressed something in my back from 

17  lifting such a heavy object.  

18      Q.  Did she give you any sort of treatment for that?  

19      A.  No, she did not.  She -- I -- she asked me if 

20  anything helps with the pain, and I told her, "Heat helps 

21  with the pain."

22      Q.  All right.  According to her records, it looks like 

23  she was talking with you about sciatica in 2021.  

24          Does that sound consistent with your memory?  

25      A.  I believe so, yes.  It was when I was doing -- 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     32

 1  remodeling my backyard so --  

 2      Q.  How long did you have the pain radiating down both 

 3  of your legs?  

 4      A.  I believe it was a short amount of time after that.  

 5  It wasn't an extended amount of time.  

 6      Q.  Are we talking weeks or months?  

 7      A.  I don't believe it was more than a month, not at 

 8  all.  

 9      Q.  Did the sciatica, for the pain that was going down 

10  your legs, then just resolve and go away?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  Did you have any episodes like that where you had 

13  pain running down your legs after that episode?  

14      A.  No, I did not.  

15      Q.  Did you receive medical care from anybody, other 

16  than Dr. Gonzales, for the pain in your legs that you were 

17  talking about there?  

18      A.  No, I did not.  

19      Q.  Okay.  It looks like, in 2021, you also had a CT 

20  scan of your face and your facial bones?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  What was that for?  

23      A.  It was from the past assault I had had.  I'm having 

24  trouble, like, snoring; so I wanted to know if I needed a 

25  sleep ap machine or what was going on.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     33

 1      Q.  And what were you told about the results of the 

 2  imaging that you had of your face at that time?  

 3      A.  I think that they told me that they didn't think 

 4  that I needed a sleep ap machine, that they think it was an 

 5  allergy thing.  So they never said anything else about the 

 6  injury I had to my face.  

 7      Q.  Did you get referred to see an ear, nose, and throat 

 8  specialist?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  What did the ear, nose, and throat specialist tell 

11  you about your deviated septum?  

12      A.  That's, actually, when I found out I had a deviated 

13  septum.  

14      Q.  What did you learn?  

15      A.  I just learned that it was a deviated septum.  I 

16  asked him if he could fix it, so I could breathe through my 

17  left nostril.  He said it would be, like, a pretty big 

18  surgery and not very beneficial.  He thought -- because the 

19  whole thing was for the sleep ap machine, because my wife 

20  says she believes I stop breathing when I'm sleeping, and I 

21  snore real loud.  We was thinking, if I opened up my airway 

22  through my nose, it would help with my breathing and 

23  sleeping.  

24      Q.  What did the ENT doctor tell you about that in 

25  particular?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     34

 1      A.  That he just wanted to run a bunch of scans to see 

 2  if I was allergic to something; so I ended up getting a 

 3  nose -- nasal spray, and it helps open it up; so that's just 

 4  what I use now.  

 5      Q.  You still use nasal spray?  

 6      A.  Yes.  

 7      Q.  Do you happen to know what the nasal spray is?  Is 

 8  it Afrin?  

 9      A.  Erin Gonzales prescribed it to me.  

10      Q.  How often do you use it?  

11      A.  I would say only if it gets real bad, so maybe once 

12  a month.  I mean, one thing lasts a whole year, so -- 

13      Q.  Do you associate that with seasonal allergies?  

14      A.  No, because it's constant.  Like, even right now, I 

15  can't breathe through this left nostril.  I use, like, a 

16  little nasal thing I get at Fred Meyer, and it helps open 

17  up.  So I use that pretty much daily -- this thing.  

18      Q.  It looks like you brought -- can I take a quick look 

19  at it?  

20      A.  Yeah.  So I'll use that to help open up.  

21      Q.  It's just an over-the-counter?  

22      A.  Yeah.  You get it in the aisleway at Fred Meyer.  

23      Q.  It says Benzedrex, B-e-n-z-e-d-r-e-x, nasal 

24  decongestant?  

25      A.  Yeah.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     35

 1      Q.  Is it a spray?  

 2      A.  It's like a menthol thing that, kind of, helps open 

 3  up if I can't breathe very good.  I work in construction, so 

 4  I breathe a lot of dust, so --  

 5      Q.  Does that help you?  

 6      A.  Yeah.  

 7      Q.  Have you been diagnosed, officially, with sleep 

 8  apnea?  

 9      A.  I have not.  

10      Q.  Have you had a sleep study to determine whether you, 

11  in fact, have sleep apnea?  

12      A.  I have not.  

13      Q.  I take it, then, that you don't use a CPAP machine 

14  at night?  

15      A.  I do not.  

16      Q.  Do you have any plans to be evaluated for sleep 

17  apnea?  

18      A.  Yeah.  I went up to see them, and then they sent me 

19  to the ear, nose, and throat.  And then that's when I went 

20  and seen them because the sleep place said I was too young 

21  and my vitals are too good to have sleep apnea.  So they 

22  sent me to the ear, nose, and throat and told me to have 

23  them figure out this thing first before they wanted to put 

24  me on a sleep ap machine, because they said that's a pretty 

25  serious thing so.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     36

 1      Q.  By "that thing," you were referring to the -- to 

 2  your sinuses where you have the fractures?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  Do you have any plans to return and see an ear, 

 5  nose, and throat physician about any of your sinus issues?  

 6      A.  I do, but I didn't get anywhere last time.  It was 

 7  just a bunch of referrals back and forth, and I didn't 

 8  really get anywhere with them.  

 9      Q.  Nothing scheduled?  

10      A.  Nothing.  

11      Q.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So, it looks like, at 

12  least in sort of chronological order, after you had the CT 

13  of your face, you went to see the ear, nose, and throat 

14  doctor, and that was Dr. Souza; correct?  

15      A.  I -- 

16      Q.  Do you remember?  

17      A.  I -- I don't remember the name.  

18      Q.  And then it looks like, after that, fairly close in 

19  time, in January of 2022, your wife reached Dr. Gonzales 

20  expressing interest in you having a vasectomy?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  All right.  I wanted to make sure we're on the same 

23  page there.  Tell me what you recall about that, please.  

24      A.  I believe that my wife wanted to get off birth 

25  control; so I figured I would be the one to get a vasectomy.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     37

 1      Q.  She had been using the birth control pill up to that 

 2  point?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  She was ready to get off of that, so you folks 

 5  talked about longer-term birth control?  

 6      A.  Sure.  

 7      Q.  And it sounds like the choice was for you to have a 

 8  vasectomy?  

 9      A.  Yes.  

10      Q.  Had you been evaluated for vasectomy before that 

11  thinking in January of '22?  

12      A.  No.  

13      Q.  In other words, had you ever had an opportunity 

14  where you were talking to one of your doctors, and you asked 

15  your doctor about having a vasectomy and have any 

16  conversations like that before January of 2022?  

17      A.  Not at all.  

18      Q.  Okay.  All right.  And so it looks like, according 

19  to a phone note, your wife called Dr. Gonzales to express 

20  interest in you having a vasectomy.  

21          Do you happen to remember anything about your wife 

22  calling Dr. Gonzales about that?  

23      A.  I don't.  I just know that I left it up to her to 

24  make the appointment and figure out what we were going to 

25  do.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     38

 1      Q.  Okay.  And according to the note, she asked 

 2  Dr. Gonzales about having a vasectomy, and Dr. Gonzales 

 3  reported that she, Dr. Gonzales, doesn't perform 

 4  vasectomies, but she could refer you to Dr. Peters, who was 

 5  in her clinic, or to Dr. Barrett, a urologist.  

 6          Do you have any memory of that?  

 7      A.  I do not.  

 8      Q.  Okay.  Do you have any memory of your wife reporting 

 9  back to you that Dr. Gonzales doesn't do vasectomies?  

10      A.  No, I do not.  

11      Q.  Did you, yourself, have any conversations with 

12  Dr. Gonzales about you having a vasectomy?  

13      A.  No, I did not.  

14      Q.  Okay.  Did you ever ask Dr. Gonzales if she 

15  performed vasectomies?  

16      A.  No, I did not.  

17      Q.  Do you remember your wife ever reporting to you that 

18  Dr. Gonzales said something to the effect of:  There's a 

19  doctor in her clinic that could do it, or there's a 

20  urologist, a specialist, named Dr. Barrett, who could do it?  

21      A.  I don't remember that.  I remember her just saying 

22  that there's an appointment to go see Dr. Peters at 

23  Sky Lakes.  That's all I remember.  

24      Q.  Did you, yourself, do any sort of research about 

25  vasectomies before your wife called Dr. Gonzales to raise 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     39

 1  the issue?  

 2      A.  No, I did not.  

 3      Q.  So, for example, did you ever look and see who, here 

 4  in Klamath Falls, performed vasectomies?  

 5      A.  I did not, no.  

 6      Q.  Odd question, but I have to ask:  Did you have any 

 7  friends or colleagues, who had vasectomies, that you asked 

 8  them about their experience?  

 9      A.  Yes, several.  

10      Q.  You did.  Okay.  

11          And did you have any of those discussions, before 

12  January of 2022, when your wife reached out to Dr. Gonzales?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Did any of those people, that you asked your friends 

15  or colleagues about vasectomies, tell you about who had 

16  performed theirs?  

17      A.  Not that who had performed theirs, but more of it's 

18  pretty simple; in and out, you're good to go.  Never like 

19  who did theirs, so --  

20      Q.  Okay.  Do you recall having any of them -- either 

21  you asking them or them telling you -- about the doctor who 

22  performed their vasectomy?  

23      A.  No.  It wasn't until later did a guy at work tell me 

24  that he got his over in Medford.  

25      Q.  One of your work colleagues told you that?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     40

 1      A.  Yeah, yeah.  

 2      Q.  How did that come up in conversation?  Why was he 

 3  sharing that?  

 4      A.  Because I was trying get a second opinion.  

 5      Q.  Ah.  So did he give you the name of the person who 

 6  performed his?  

 7      A.  Yes, he did.  

 8      Q.  Who was the person who performed his?  

 9      A.  Dr. Bui at Rogue Valley Urology.  

10      Q.  Who you did end up seeing after the fact --  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  -- correct?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Did any of your friends or colleagues, or anybody 

15  you spoke to about vasectomies, mention anything about 

16  whether they had gone to Dr. Peters to have a vasectomy?  

17      A.  No.  

18      Q.  How about Dr. Barrett, a urologist?  

19      A.  No.  

20      Q.  How about Dr. Smith, Dwight Smith?  

21      A.  No.  

22      Q.  Okay.  To your knowledge, did you speak with anybody 

23  who had a vasectomy from any of those providers before you 

24  had your vasectomy?  

25      A.  Not to my knowledge, no.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     41

 1      Q.  Do you remember anything else your wife told you 

 2  about any of her interactions related to the vasectomy 

 3  before she told you, you had an appointment scheduled?  

 4      A.  I don't -- I just know that she was going to take 

 5  care of it and get the appointment scheduled and set up a 

 6  consultation for me to meet with the doctor.  

 7      Q.  Okay.  All right.  And then it looks like, according 

 8  to some records I have, that you went in to see Dr. Peters 

 9  in February of 2022 for the purpose of discussing a 

10  vasectomy.  

11          Do I have that right?  

12      A.  Correct.  

13      Q.  Okay.  Did you go to that visit with Dr. Peters by 

14  yourself?  

15      A.  Yes, I did.  

16      Q.  Your wife did not go with you?  

17      A.  No, she did not.  

18      Q.  That was a scheduled appointment?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  Had you had any communication with Dr. Peters before 

21  that appointment?  

22      A.  No, I have not.  

23      Q.  Okay.  And it sounds like you and your wife had 

24  decided that you didn't want any additional children; is 

25  that right?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     42

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  Okay.  So tell me, please, what you remember about 

 3  that first visit with Dr. Peters?  

 4      A.  I remember going up, going into the room, him 

 5  sitting me down, and asking me -- just introducing himself 

 6  to me, and then -- you need to have questions that he asked, 

 7  or is that what you're asking?  

 8      Q.  Yes.  I want to make sure I have fully explored your 

 9  memory of that visit, and I can walk you through that, if 

10  that's helpful.  

11          It sounds like you went to the clinic.  You met him 

12  in an examination room; is that right?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Do you remember him introducing himself?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  Okay.  Do you remember him asking you why you were 

17  there, and you telling him why you were there?  

18      A.  Yes.  

19      Q.  Did you tell him that you were there to talk about a 

20  vasectomy?  

21      A.  Yes.  

22      Q.  Do you remember anybody else being in the room with 

23  the two of you during this interaction?  

24      A.  I do not.  

25      Q.  Okay.  According to his records, anyway, he took a 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     43

 1  bit of a history about you, about your marriage, your 

 2  children?  

 3          Do you remember having those types of discussions 

 4  with him?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  Okay.  You talked about the fact that you were with 

 7  your wife and your marriage was stable.  

 8          Do you remember those types of discussions?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  Okay.  And he said that you were expressing a desire 

11  to undergo a permanent sterilization procedure with a 

12  vasectomy?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  He documented performing a physical exam.  

15          Do you remember him doing an exam?  

16      A.  Yes, I do.  

17      Q.  Tell me, please, what you remember about that.  

18      A.  He had me just pull down my pants, and he felt my 

19  scrotum for a few minutes on both sides, and just he told me 

20  that he thinks everything is good, and everything and is 

21  going to be good to go.  

22      Q.  Okay.  Before that day and that visit with 

23  Dr. Peters, have you ever had any trauma to your groin?  

24      A.  No.  

25      Q.  So, just to make sure that I ask that broadly 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     44

 1  enough, that would include physical altercations, assaults, 

 2  sports injuries -- anything where you had injury to your 

 3  groin?  

 4      A.  No.  Like I told him later on, I said -- because he 

 5  never even asked me if I had an injury to my crotch before 

 6  this.  So I told him, "Maybe as a kid, I may have fell off 

 7  my bike or something, but I don't remember," you know, so -- 

 8  but as far as I can remember, I've never had a injuries to 

 9  my groin area.  

10      Q.  Certainly nothing that required you to go in and be 

11  seen by a doctor?  

12      A.  Definitely not.  

13      Q.  All right.  When Dr. Peters performed the physical 

14  exam, that you described of your scrotum, did you have any 

15  sort of pain or discomfort during his examination?  

16      A.  No, I did not.  

17      Q.  Do you remember Dr. Peters saying anything to you, 

18  as he was doing the examination, about anything he was or 

19  was not finding?  

20      A.  No.  He said that something was mobile, and I didn't 

21  understand what that meant, and that it was -- everything 

22  would be fine, and he'd have me in and out of here in 

23  15 minutes.  

24      Q.  Do you remember him, actually, saying words to the 

25  effect of, "in and out in 15 minutes"?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     45

 1      A.  Yes.  

 2      Q.  Tell me, to the best of your memory, what you recall 

 3  him telling you about that.  

 4      A.  Well, when I went in there, I told him, "I'm not 

 5  really sold on this," you know.  I -- and that's when he 

 6  told me, "If you love your wife, that you would get the 

 7  procedure done, because I'd have you in and out of here in 

 8  15 minutes.  There's no point in putting your wife through a 

 9  major surgery," because I was trying to get her to have an 

10  hysterectomy or something else, because I'm scared to death 

11  of it, you know.  

12      Q.  It sounds like you made mention of that to 

13  Dr. Peters?  

14      A.  Yes.  

15      Q.  Do you remember anything else that Dr. Peters said 

16  to you about the procedure or the process at that point?  

17      A.  He just told me, "It's a simple process.  I'll have 

18  you in and out of here in, like, 15 minutes."  

19          And I told him, "Okay."

20      Q.  Did he tell you where the procedure would be 

21  performed?  

22      A.  He said in the office, in there where I was at, 

23  so --  

24      Q.  Did you have any discussion with Dr. Peters about 

25  his experience with vasectomies?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     46

 1      A.  No.  He just said he's done lots of them.  That's 

 2  the only thing he told me, so -- 

 3      Q.  Do you remember what words he used in that regard?  

 4      A.  I do not.  

 5      Q.  When you say that he said he had done lots, that's 

 6  your interpretation of what he told you?  

 7      A.  Yeah, because -- yes.  

 8      Q.  Do you know if that came from you asking him the  

 9  question, or did that just come up in the discussion?  

10      A.  I think it was more of him comforting me, telling me 

11  that, you know, "I'll take care of you.  I'll have you in 

12  and out of here."

13      Q.  Did he talk with you about any of the details of how 

14  the vasectomy would be performed?  For example, with a 

15  scalpel, with a different instrument -- anything like that?  

16      A.  Yes.  I believe he explained to me the process of 

17  doing it.  He said something along the lines of "a small 

18  incision," and I would be able to return to work on Monday.  

19      Q.  And if you were able to return to work on Monday, 

20  when was he thinking the procedure would be scheduled?  On a 

21  Friday?  

22      A.  Correct.  I asked him if we could schedule it for a 

23  Friday, because as a project manager, I have to be on 

24  projects and everything, and if I needed, he said, a couple 

25  days to recover, then I wanted it done on a Friday.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     47

 1      Q.  With an expectation that you'd be back to work on 

 2  Monday?  

 3      A.  Correct.

 4      Q.  Do you remember anything else Dr. Peters said to 

 5  you, specifically, about the way the procedure would be 

 6  performed?  

 7      A.  I believe he just said that there would be a small 

 8  incision in the top of the groin area is where he would -- 

 9  there was -- he said something about cutting the stuff in 

10  there, but I don't remember exactly the names or anything, 

11  so -- 

12      Q.  Did he use any models, or anything like that, to 

13  describe it?  

14      A.  I can't recall.  I don't -- I don't remember exactly 

15  if -- how it was, whether it was a chart on the wall or a 

16  model.  I can't remember.  

17      Q.  Did Dr. Peters answer every question that you asked 

18  of him at that visit?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  Dr. Peters' record from that visit indicates that he 

21  had a PARQ conference, and I'll represent to you that "PARQ" 

22  stands for a discussion about the procedure, the 

23  alternatives, going over the risks, and answering questions.  

24          And he said that, in the context of that discussion, 

25  there was a discussion about the risks and the benefits of a 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     48

 1  no-scalpel vasectomy procedure.  

 2          Do you remember him using a term like, "no-scalpel 

 3  vasectomy"?  

 4      A.  No, I don't.  

 5      Q.  Do you remember him talking, at all, about a scalpel 

 6  or lack of a scalpel?  

 7      A.  He said that there would just be a small incision, 

 8  so -- 

 9      Q.  Do you remember Dr. Peters talking with you about 

10  the risks that come with having a vasectomy?  

11      A.  He said that there's less than a 1 percent chance 

12  that you would ever have pain.  

13      Q.  You remember that, in particular?  

14      A.  I believe, yes.  

15      Q.  Your memory is he told you there's a less than 

16  1 percent risk of --  

17      A.  Correct.  

18      Q.  -- ongoing pain?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  After vasectomy?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  His record indicates that the risks he discussed 

23  including -- included the risk of bleeding.  

24          Do you remember him taking with you about that?  

25      A.  I believe he said it would be minimal, if any blood 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     49

 1  at all.  

 2      Q.  One risk is infection.  

 3          Do you remember him telling you that one of the 

 4  risks was infection?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  Okay.  He listed the risk of pain.  

 7          It sounds like you do remember him talking with you 

 8  about that?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  He said he spoke with you about the risk of failed 

11  sterilization, and what he indicated about that is that one 

12  risk of having a vasectomy is you could have a failed 

13  sterilization, and you have to have some follow-up, you 

14  know, to make sure that it was successful.  

15          Do you remember talking about that in general?  

16      A.  Correct.  

17      Q.  He also listed a risk of damaged surrounding 

18  structures; that things could be injured while they are 

19  doing the vasectomy.  

20          Do you remember a discussion about that?  

21      A.  I do not.  

22      Q.  He talked with you about the statistical chances of 

23  reversing a vasectomy.  So, if a patient has a vasectomy and 

24  decides, you know, "Gosh, I've decided I want to have kids, 

25  and I want to reverse it," there's a process of reversal.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     50

 1          Do you remember Dr. Peters talking with you about 

 2  that?  

 3      A.  I don't.  

 4      Q.  Okay.  Now, is that something that you just don't 

 5  recall, but you don't deny, or is that something you deny 

 6  that he talked with you about?  

 7      A.  That, I just -- I don't remember him asking me or 

 8  telling me that there's a chance that you can reverse it.  

 9      Q.  Okay.  Did Dr. Peters talk with you at all about 

10  anybody else being involved in the procedure?  

11      A.  No, he did not.  

12          (Deposition Exhibit 1 was marked and is 

13          attached hereto.)

14      Q.  BY MR. TUENGE:  Okay.  All right.  And I'm going to 

15  mark as an exhibit a document.  As we go along, there are a 

16  few documents that I may mark as exhibits.  That means we're 

17  going to put a sticker on it.  

18      A.  Okay.  

19      Q.  I'm going to ask you questions about, and it will be 

20  attached to your exhibits.  This first document we'll mark 

21  as Exhibit 1.  

22          So, all right.  I've marked, as an exhibit, a 

23  document that is entitled to, "Consent for Sterilization," 

24  marked as Exhibit 1.  

25          Is this a document that you recognize?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     51

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  It's dated February 15, 2022, which I'll represent 

 3  to you is the same date as that initial office visit with 

 4  Dr. Peters.  

 5          Does that make sense to you?  

 6      A.  Correct.  

 7      Q.  Do you remember that, as part of this discussion and 

 8  process with Dr. Peters on that day, he presented you with 

 9  this form as a consent to sterilization?  

10      A.  Correct.  

11      Q.  Gave you an opportunity to read it, review it, and  

12  asked you to sign it?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Is that your signature we see about halfway down 

15  over on the right side?  

16      A.  Correct.  

17      Q.  Do you remember asking Dr. Peters any questions 

18  about the form or any of the information on it?  

19      A.  I did not.  

20      Q.  At that point when you signed the form, were you 

21  comfortable proceeding with Dr. Peters and going forward and 

22  having him do a sterilization and vasectomy on you?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  During that initial visit with Dr. Peters, did you 

25  find him to be a good listener to anything you had to say to 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     52

 1  him?  

 2      A.  Correct.  

 3      Q.  And I already asked you, that he answered all the 

 4  questions you had; correct?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  It looks like he gave you some instructions about 

 7  preparing for the procedure.  

 8          Do you remember that?  

 9      A.  Yes.  

10      Q.  Did you then schedule the procedure before you left 

11  the office, or did that happen later?  

12      A.  I believe they called, and he said he had to wait a 

13  certain amount -- I had to wait a certain amount of days in 

14  case I needed to change my mind.  

15      Q.  I saw a reference to that.  

16      A.  So -- 

17      Q.  He talked to you about having to wait a certain 

18  period of time?  

19      A.  Sure.  

20      Q.  Got it.  Okay.  So then, at some point, somebody 

21  called you to get the vasectomy procedure scheduled on the 

22  calendar?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  Were you involved in that scheduling call, or was 

25  that something your wife handled?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     53

 1      A.  I believe it was my wife.  

 2      Q.  Between that initial visit on February 15, 2022, 

 3  when you signed the sterilization form and when you actually 

 4  returned for the vasectomy in between that time, did you do 

 5  any research at all about vasectomies?  

 6      A.  I did not.  

 7      Q.  Did you take any of the information that Dr. Peters 

 8  had shared with you, at that initial visit, and research it 

 9  at all?  

10      A.  I did not.  

11      Q.  Did you have any discussions with any medical people 

12  about any of the information Dr. Peters shared with you at 

13  that first visit, but before you had your vasectomy?  

14      A.  I did not.  

15      Q.  All right.  So, it looks like, then, according to 

16  the records, your vasectomy was scheduled and occurred on 

17  April 8th?  

18      A.  Correct.  

19      Q.  Is that consistent with your memory?  

20      A.  Yes.  

21      Q.  So your initial visit was on February 15th.  You had 

22  to wait that 30-day time period or whatnot, and then it was 

23  scheduled for April 8th --  

24      A.  Correct.  

25      Q.  -- is that right?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     54

 1          Okay.  Did you continue to feel comfortable going 

 2  forward with and having a vasectomy by Dr. Peters up to 

 3  February -- excuse me -- April 8th when you arrived at the 

 4  office?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  And I don't see any record where you went to see 

 7  Dr. Gonzales between your first visit with Dr. Peters on 

 8  February 15th and when you had your vasectomy on April 8th.  

 9          Is that consistent with your memory?  

10      A.  Correct.  

11      Q.  So you didn't have any discussion with Dr. Gonzales 

12  about any vasectomy details?  

13      A.  None.  

14      Q.  What time, if you recall, were you asked to arrive 

15  at the clinic for the vasectomy on April 8th?  

16      A.  I believe it was just a few minutes before the  

17  procedure.  

18      Q.  Was it a morning procedure?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  Do you happen to remember what time?  

21      A.  I do not.  

22      Q.  Was the procedure scheduled to take place at the 

23  very same place where you had seen Dr. Peters on 

24  February 15th?  

25      A.  He said in the same building, I believe.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     55

 1      Q.  Was that the Cascades East building?  

 2      A.  Correct.  

 3      Q.  Did you arrive for your vasectomy that day on your 

 4  own?  

 5      A.  No, I did not.  

 6      Q.  Did somebody come with you?  

 7      A.  My wife and kids dropped me off.  

 8      Q.  And when you say dropped you off, does that mean, 

 9  literally, they had you get out, and then they departed in 

10  their vehicle?  

11      A.  Correct.  It was a time of Covid, and they didn't -- 

12  the hospital didn't really -- they had lots of rules going 

13  on; so everybody had to wear masks.  I know my son was sick 

14  and not feeling good; so, yeah, they waited out in the car 

15  so -- 

16      Q.  Did they wait out in the car throughout the process 

17  of the vasectomy?  

18      A.  For an extended period of time.  At one point they 

19  ended up leaving.  

20      Q.  Was the plan, when you arrived, that they were going 

21  to just stay in the car in the parking lot for your 

22  procedure and then be there when you got done?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  Did any of them come into the clinic that day?  

25      A.  I do not believe so.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     56

 1      Q.  All right.  So they dropped you off.  You came into 

 2  the clinic.  Did you go through a process of being checked 

 3  in?  

 4      A.  Yeah.  It seemed as if they were waiting for me.  I 

 5  don't believe I sat down in the lobby.  They pushed me right 

 6  in.  

 7      Q.  You were taken back into a procedure room of some 

 8  kind?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  Once you got back into the procedure room, what do 

11  you recall happening?  

12      A.  I believe Erin Gonzales -- or not Erin Gonzales -- 

13  but Rene and Dr. Peters were in the room, and they gave me a 

14  gown and told me to get into the gown.  

15      Q.  Who is Rene?  

16      A.  Erin Gonzales's assistant.  

17      Q.  So they told you to put on a gown?  

18      A.  Correct.  

19      Q.  You did that?  

20      A.  Yes.  

21      Q.  What happened next?  

22      A.  Then they came back in the room, and I got up on the 

23  examining table, I would call it.  

24      Q.  All right.  What happened after you were up on the 

25  table?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     57

 1      A.  I believe Dr. Peters just, you know, said "Hi," see 

 2  how I'm doing and everything, and then they proceeded to get 

 3  out the needle to numb the area that was going to be worked 

 4  on.  

 5      Q.  Dr. Peters, in his record, I'll indicate that he 

 6  charted performing a physical examination of your groin 

 7  before starting the procedure.  

 8          Do you have a memory of him doing that?  

 9      A.  Correct, yes.  

10      Q.  What do you recall about that?  

11      A.  It was a lot like just the first time when I seen 

12  him in February.  It was just feeling around.  

13      Q.  Do you remember anything different about that 

14  examination or anything he said?  

15      A.  No.  He just said that he felt like everything felt 

16  good.  He felt confident.  I could see it in his eyes, he 

17  was confident.  So I was relaxed and confident.  

18      Q.  Okay.  Did he say anything about his confidence?  

19      A.  No.  You could just see it in his eyes, I guess.  

20      Q.  Did you ask him any questions before the procedure 

21  started?  

22      A.  No, I did not.  

23      Q.  So, after he performed his physical examination, do 

24  you recall him bringing out a needle to start the 

25  anesthesia?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     58

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  Was he the one with the needle, as opposed to his 

 3  assistant, or somebody else?  

 4      A.  Yes.  It was him.  

 5      Q.  What do you recall about that?  

 6      A.  I just -- laying there on the table, and he just put 

 7  a needle into my scrotum.  

 8      Q.  His note, I'll represent to you, says that a heating 

 9  pad as placed over your scrotum for about 10 or 15 minutes, 

10  and then you were placed in the procedure chair.  

11          Do you have a memory of that process?  

12      A.  Yes, I do.  He said it would help the "lacticity," 

13  or something, of the scrotum to kind of just relax.  

14      Q.  Okay.  So you went through that process, and then he 

15  described using some medical material to clean the area 

16  before starting the procedure with something call 

17  Chlorhexidine.  

18          Do you remember that?  

19      A.  I remember them cleaning the area, correct.  

20      Q.  All right.  And he indicated he administered the 

21  anesthetic.  It sounds like you do recall that?  

22      A.  Yes.  

23      Q.  When he used the needle, initially, to administer 

24  the anesthetic, do you recall having anesthetic relief; in 

25  other words, it worked, and you couldn't feel that area?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     59

 1      A.  Yeah.  

 2      Q.  So, after that process, now he's used the needle for 

 3  the first time; he's applied the anesthesia, and it worked.  

 4          What happened?  

 5      A.  He just made sure I was laying flat on the table, 

 6  and what -- I believe he made the incision.  I could, kind 

 7  of, feel what was going on; so there was times when he would 

 8  stop and put more of the numbing solution in there.  

 9      Q.  At that point in time, was there anybody else in the 

10  room, other than you and Dr. Peters?  

11      A.  Rene, the assistant.  

12      Q.  Was Rene in the room consistently from the time you 

13  got into the room up until the time the procedure started?  

14      A.  Yes.  

15      Q.  So she stayed in the room; she wasn't coming in and 

16  out?  

17      A.  Not at that -- not until the procedure started, no.  

18      Q.  Do you recall anybody else coming into the room 

19  before the procedure started?  

20      A.  I -- I do not.  

21      Q.  All right.  So you -- do you recall Dr. Peters 

22  actually starting the procedure and opening up your scrotum?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  Do you know what tool or what instrument he was 

25  using?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     60

 1      A.  I do not.  

 2      Q.  And did I understand correctly that you could feel 

 3  that initially?  

 4      A.  I could feel almost like a burning or like a -- I 

 5  could feel something.  I don't know if it was like -- 

 6  everything was so numb, but I could still feel something 

 7  going on, because I'm laying flat on the table.  I can't see 

 8  what's going on.  I'm laying flat like that, and with all 

 9  the metal in my spine, I can't -- you know, he didn't ask me 

10  to get up and look at what he was doing.  So I didn't -- I 

11  don't know what was going on.  

12      Q.  So you were staring at the ceiling?  

13      A.  Yeah.  

14      Q.  But you could feel something going on in your groin?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  Did you mention that to Dr. Peters, that you could 

17  feel it?  

18      A.  Correct.  

19      Q.  When you say you could feel it, was it pain that you 

20  could feel?  

21      A.  It was more like discomfort, kind of -- I don't 

22  know -- not necessarily shocking, but just like jerking 

23  where he would stop and give me more lidocaine, and it would 

24  help.  

25      Q.  Were you actually physically jerking when that was 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     61

 1  happening?  

 2      A.  I was -- yeah, I believe there was a couple times 

 3  where I just kind of clenched my fist up and like leaned 

 4  back and squint my eyes, and he would stop, and then he 

 5  would give me more lidocaine.  

 6      Q.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  So during that 

 7  process, when you would feel that and get tense and he would 

 8  give you more lidocaine, during that process, did anybody 

 9  else come into the room?  

10      A.  No.  

11      Q.  Do you remember any discussion you had with 

12  Dr. Peters, during that process, where you're feeling 

13  discomfort and he gave you more anesthetic?  

14      A.  No.  

15      Q.  Okay.  So, then, keep going.  What do you remember 

16  happening next?  

17      A.  I just remember it kind of felt like -- I don't know 

18  if it was pulling or -- the things that I could hear, you 

19  know, it was just painful when he was doing it.  So several 

20  times he put lidocaine in there to try to calm me down, 

21  because it was hurting.  I -- I don't know if it was tearing 

22  or what it was, but --  

23      Q.  Where was it painful?  

24      A.  It just felt like it was just my scrotum itself, 

25  like -- I don't know if it was -- I couldn't pinpoint 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     62

 1  exactly where it was.  It was more, like, just, like, inside 

 2  my scrotum.  

 3      Q.  Did it radiate out from the scrotum anywhere?  

 4      A.  No.  

 5      Q.  When Dr. Peters would give you more anesthetic with 

 6  the needle, did that seem to help?  

 7      A.  Yes.  

 8      Q.  Do you remember Dr. Peters saying anything to 

 9  anybody else in the room, other than you, during that 

10  process?  

11      A.  He asked at one point for Rene to go get somebody.  

12      Q.  Do you remember what he said?  

13      A.  I don't remember exactly what he said, no.  

14      Q.  Did she leave the room at that point?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  Did she return to the room?  

17      A.  Correct.  

18      Q.  Do you know how long she was gone?  

19      A.  It was probably less than ten minutes.  

20      Q.  When she came back, did she bring anybody with her?  

21      A.  Yes.  

22      Q.  Who?  

23      A.  I believe Dr. Smith.  

24      Q.  Was that the first time you had seen Dr. Smith?  

25      A.  Correct.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     63

 1      Q.  You hadn't met him before on any occasion?  

 2      A.  No, I have not.  

 3      Q.  What happened when Dr. Smith came into the room?  

 4      A.  He just helped Dr. Peters.  

 5      Q.  Did Dr. Smith introduce himself?  

 6      A.  Correct.  

 7      Q.  So he told you who he was?  

 8      A.  Yes.  

 9      Q.  Did he say anything to you about why he was there?  

10      A.  I do not recall.  

11      Q.  During this process, up to the time Dr. Smith 

12  arrived in the room, you were laying on your back on a 

13  procedure table; is that right?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  What side was Dr. Peters on?  

16      A.  I believe Dr. Peters was right between my legs, and 

17  if I remember correctly, when the other doctor came in, he 

18  came in over from the right, from my right side.  

19      Q.  Did Dr. Peters stay between your legs?  

20      A.  Yes.  

21      Q.  While Dr. Smith was there, did Dr. Smith stay on 

22  your right side?  

23      A.  I believe so. 

24      Q.  So Dr. Smith came in; he introduced himself.  

25          What happened next?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     64

 1      A.  They proceeded to try and get the procedure done 

 2  together.  

 3      Q.  Do you remember any discussion between the two of 

 4  them?  

 5      A.  I don't.  I just remember that, a couple times, I 

 6  heard him say that he didn't think he got it.  That's all I 

 7  heard.  

 8      Q.  Who said that?  

 9      A.  I believe it was Dr. Peters.  

10      Q.  Do you remember Dr. Smith using any of the tools or 

11  the instruments?  

12      A.  I did not see any of the tools or instruments being 

13  used.  

14      Q.  Okay.  So as you sit here today, you don't know who 

15  was using which tools when?  

16      A.  I don't.  

17      Q.  All right.  Do you recall having any discussion with 

18  either Dr. Peters or Dr. Smith about stopping the procedure?  

19      A.  No.  

20      Q.  Is that something that you don't recall one way or 

21  the other, or is that something that you specifically deny?  

22      A.  At no point did they ask me or say they were going 

23  to stop the procedure.  

24      Q.  Did you at any point raise any question about 

25  stopping the procedure?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     65

 1      A.  No, I did not.  

 2      Q.  Did you raise any question or any issue with how 

 3  long things were taking?  

 4      A.  I didn't.  I just -- I just told them that I was in 

 5  a lot of pain.  

 6      Q.  When you said that you were in a lot of pain, was 

 7  the pain located inside the scrotum, like you described 

 8  before?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  Was the pain located anywhere else at that point?  

11      A.  No.  

12      Q.  Was there any discussion at all about you going to 

13  somebody else or another provider to finish the procedure?  

14      A.  Not at all.  

15      Q.  Was there any discussion, at all with you, about any 

16  difficulty locating any of your anatomy?  

17      A.  He just said that he was having trouble.  

18      Q.  When you say, "he," was that Dr. Peters?  

19      A.  Dr. Peters, yeah.  

20      Q.  You do remember him saying something to you about 

21  him having some trouble?  

22      A.  Yeah.  Trying to find whatever he was looking for.  

23      Q.  Okay.  Is that your best recollection of what he 

24  said, or do you remember any more details about what he 

25  said?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     66

 1      A.  I don't remember any more details about what he 

 2  said.  

 3      Q.  Okay.  Do you have any estimate, for me, how long 

 4  the procedure had been going when Dr. Smith arrived in the 

 5  room?  

 6      A.  If I had to give an estimate, it would be about a 

 7  half hour.  

 8      Q.  And just so I understand that, your estimate is it 

 9  had started and had been going about a half an hour by the 

10  time Dr. Smith arrived?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  Sounds like you didn't look at a watch or a clock; 

13  that's just an estimate?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  Once Dr. Smith arrived in the room, did he stay in 

16  the room until the procedure was over, or did he leave and 

17  come back?  

18      A.  He left and came back.  

19      Q.  How many times did he leave and come back?  

20      A.  Just once.  

21      Q.  Do you know why he left?  

22      A.  He said something about having to do a circumcision.  

23  He had to leave to go do another surgery, a circumcision.  

24      Q.  You remember he said that, and then he left room, 

25  and he came back?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     67

 1      A.  Yeah.  

 2      Q.  Do you have any estimate how long he was gone?  

 3      A.  If I had to put a time, I would say at least a half 

 4  hour.  

 5      Q.  What is your estimate for how long the entire 

 6  process took place, from the time you sat up on the bed in 

 7  your procedure gown until you stood up and left that room?  

 8      A.  If I had to put a time on it, I would say probably 

 9  close to two hours, hour and 45 minutes, something like 

10  that.  

11      Q.  At any point in that approximately hour and 45 or 

12  two hours, as you recall it, did you raise any question with 

13  Dr. Peters about how long this was taking?  

14      A.  I did not.  I was just quiet and trying to hold 

15  still.  

16      Q.  Okay.  Throughout that time, did you continue to get 

17  additional injections of anesthesia?  

18      A.  Correct.  

19      Q.  Was there ever a point where you got a dose of 

20  anesthesia, and that was it; it worked; you didn't need any 

21  more or where you felt totally numb?  

22      A.  I believe we used all the anesthesia there was in 

23  that thing.  

24      Q.  What makes you believe that?  

25      A.  Just how many times they had given it to me.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     68

 1      Q.  Do you have any estimate how many times they gave 

 2  you anesthesia?  

 3      A.  If I had to put a number on it, I would probably say 

 4  ten different times or close, roughly.  

 5      Q.  Did you have any discussion with Dr. Peters about 

 6  that fact, that you were getting anesthesia repeatedly and 

 7  whether that was an issue?  

 8      A.  I didn't because, when they gave it to me, it 

 9  would -- it would stop for a minute, give it to me, it would 

10  feel better, and then he would proceed on doing the 

11  procedure.  

12      Q.  Okay.  Once Dr. Smith got back in the room, what do 

13  you recall from that point up until the end of the 

14  procedure?  

15      A.  I just remember him coming in and taking a look and 

16  then he just said that, "I think we're done," and then 

17  walked out.  

18      Q.  Those were words Dr. Smith used?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  Do you remember anything else Dr. Smith said?  

21      A.  I do not.  

22      Q.  I'll represent to you that, in the records of the 

23  procedure, Dr. Peters put in his note that, at the end of 

24  the procedure, he had a discussion with you about the 

25  complexities encountered during the procedure and that he 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     69

 1  and Dr. Smith felt approximately 90 percent confident that 

 2  the structure that they had cut and cauterized was the 

 3  correct structure to complete the vasectomy.  

 4          Do you have any recollection of that discussion 

 5  toward the end or at the end of the procedure?  

 6      A.  I don't.  

 7      Q.  Do you recall any discussion with Dr. Peters at the 

 8  end of the procedure about how long it had taken?  

 9      A.  No.  He just said that -- at the end of the 

10  procedure, he said that he felt pretty confident that he had 

11  got it, but about halfway through, he wasn't -- he wasn't 

12  sure that he had gotten it.  So it was kind of hit and miss, 

13  you know.  

14      Q.  And when he -- when you say that he referred to he 

15  "got it," did you understand him meaning that he was able to 

16  get what he needed to get to give you a successful 

17  vasectomy?  

18      A.  Correct.  

19      Q.  Okay.  

20      A.  I'm having a lot of pain right now.  It's really 

21  throbbing.  

22      Q.  Do you want to take a break?  

23      A.  If I can.  It's throbbing really bad.  

24          MR. TUENGE:  Let's take a break.  

25          MR. LINTHORST:  Let's take a break.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     70

 1          THE WITNESS:  I appreciate that.  

 2          VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going off the record.  The time 

 3  is 10:28.  

 4                (Break.)

 5          VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on the record.  The time 

 6  is 10:43.  

 7      Q.  BY MR. TUENGE:  Okay.  We're back on the record.  

 8          Are you okay to continue?  

 9      A.  Yes, I am.  

10      Q.  And you did exactly what I asked, and continue to do 

11  that.  Anytime you need a break for any reason, just say the 

12  word; we'll take a break.  Take as much time as you need.  

13  Okay?  

14      A.  Thank you.  

15      Q.  All right.  So let's pick up back at the vasectomy 

16  procedure, and, actually, before the procedure started, part 

17  of the recommendations to you pre-procedure were to take -- 

18  I believe to take a Tylenol and then a medication called 

19  lorazepam, or Ativan, an anxiety medication.  

20          Do you remember having an instruction like that 

21  before the procedure?  

22      A.  Correct.  

23      Q.  Okay.  Did you take the Tylenol and the Ativan as 

24  prescribed?  

25      A.  Correct.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     71

 1      Q.  And I think one of the doses of the Ativan was to be 

 2  taken when you arrived for the procedure?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  Did you take that when you were in the waiting room?  

 5      A.  Before I went up.  

 6      Q.  Okay.  So in the office, but before you went to the 

 7  exam room?  

 8      A.  I believe so, unless it was a medication that they 

 9  gave me there.  I thought they had me take a Tylenol before 

10  I left my house along with the other pill.  

11      Q.  Okay.  

12      A.  So -- 

13      Q.  You took those as you were asked to do?  

14      A.  Yes.  

15      Q.  All right.  So, then, back to the vasectomy 

16  procedure.  We talked about the end.  I just wanted to make 

17  sure that I got a complete record on that.  

18          Have you told me everything you remember Dr. Peters 

19  telling you, at the end of the procedure, about how the 

20  procedure went and his confidence that he got the right 

21  thing?  

22      A.  I believe at the end, he said that he was pretty 

23  confident that he had got it.  

24      Q.  Do you remember anything else he said to you at the 

25  end of the procedure about how it had gone?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     72

 1      A.  He just said something along the lines of he was 

 2  having trouble; so I don't recall exactly what troubles he 

 3  was having.  

 4      Q.  Okay.  And is that the extent of what you remember 

 5  him saying about that?  

 6      A.  Yeah.  

 7      Q.  So I'll represent to you that, in Dr. Peters' 

 8  procedure note of the vasectomy, he made a mention in the 

 9  note where he said that, after over 30 minutes of attempts 

10  trying to find the anatomy by both providers -- him and 

11  Dr. Smith -- there was a discussion about aborting the 

12  procedure, stopping, and then coming back at a later date?         

13  And he mentioned in his note, "Patient requested we continue 

14  to try and avoid the need for a future procedure."

15          Does that refresh any recollection about any 

16  discussion regarding those events?  

17      A.  No.  

18      Q.  At the end of the procedure, did you have any 

19  discussion with Dr. Smith about how the procedure had gone?  

20      A.  No.  Not -- not that I recall, no.  

21      Q.  Did Dr. Smith give you any sort of summary of his 

22  analysis about what had happened?  

23      A.  I just remember them saying it was -- just having 

24  difficulty locating whatever it was that they were trying 

25  to -- trying to get, so -- 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     73

 1      Q.  Have you seen Dr. Smith since he left your vasectomy 

 2  room?  

 3      A.  That was the only time I've ever seen him.  

 4      Q.  Have you had any communication with him since he 

 5  left your vasectomy room?  

 6      A.  No, I have not.  

 7      Q.  All right.  So, then, Dr. Peters' note at the end of 

 8  the vasectomy mentioned that, if your sperm sample in three 

 9  months after the procedure was positive, then he would 

10  recommend an open approach to, basically, see if they got 

11  the right anatomy.  

12          Do you remember a discussion about a sperm sample in 

13  three months to make sure it was successful?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  Do you remember anything other than, basically, what 

16  I just summarized to you?  

17      A.  No, I don't.  

18      Q.  Did you have an understanding, as part of a 

19  vasectomy, after the vasectomy is performed, you had to 

20  provide a sperm sample to make sure it was successful?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  You knew, going in, that was going to be part of the 

23  process?  

24      A.  Correct.  

25      Q.  It looks like, according to the records, you were 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     74

 1  given some advice about wearing a jock strap and using 

 2  regular ice after the procedure.  

 3          Do you remember that advice?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  Do you remember asking any questions of Dr. Peters 

 6  or Dr. Smith after the procedure was performed, but before 

 7  you left the office?  

 8      A.  I don't remember asking him any questions after it 

 9  was done.  

10      Q.  And it sounds like you have a pretty specific memory 

11  of Rene, the medical assistant, being there during parts of 

12  the vasectomy?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Is that correct?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  Can you give me some sense, from your memory, of how 

17  much of the vasectomy procedure Rene was in the room for?  

18      A.  If I had to put a time on it, I would say like three 

19  quarters of the time.  There was times, when I would look 

20  up, and I didn't see her, but, yeah, she was there most of 

21  the time.  

22      Q.  Give me a description of what she was doing from 

23  your perspective.  I know you were staring at the ceiling.  

24          What kinds of things was she doing for three 

25  quarters of the procedure?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     75

 1      A.  He would ask her to hand him stuff or maybe do -- I 

 2  don't know -- it was do other things, like when he asked her 

 3  to go get the other doctor or just handing him, like an 

 4  assistant, just to kind of help him out and -- 

 5      Q.  Did you have any discussion with Rene, after the 

 6  procedure was done, but before you left the office, about 

 7  what happened?  

 8      A.  I did not.  

 9      Q.  Have you seen Rene since you left the vasectomy 

10  room?  

11      A.  In a follow-up visit, when I went to go see 

12  Erin Gonzales later on, I seen her in Erin Gonzales's 

13  office.  

14      Q.  At that visit did you have any discussion with Rene 

15  about anything related to your vasectomy?  

16      A.  No, I did not.  She -- I think the only thing she 

17  said was, "I'm just so sorry."

18      Q.  You do remember her saying that to you?  

19      A.  Yes.  

20      Q.  Did you have an understanding of what she was 

21  referring to?  

22      A.  Probably the amount of pain I was in and the amount 

23  of time it took that she knew -- she was witnessing what I 

24  was going through at the time of the procedure.  So she's 

25  just, kind of, showed me a little sympathy, because she 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     76

 1  could tell I couldn't walk at that time.  I'm wearing 

 2  sweatpants and tennis shoes and dragging my leg around 

 3  because it hurt so bad.  Still, at that point, I was unable 

 4  to walk really well; so, yeah, she was pretty sympathetic, I 

 5  would say.  

 6      Q.  Other than that comment, did you have any other 

 7  interactions with her after the vasectomy?  

 8      A.  No, I did not.  

 9      Q.  All right.  So, then, it looks like you were given 

10  some ibuprofen and some oxycodone, at the end of the 

11  procedure, to take home with you.  

12          Do you remember that?  

13      A.  After they wheeled me over to the hospital to try to 

14  get pain medication -- I was unable to get any at the time 

15  so then I had to go to -- my wife went to Albertsons and got 

16  me pain medication.  

17      Q.  Ah, okay.  Let me make sure that I understand that 

18  correctly.  

19          At the end of the procedure, they wanted you to have 

20  Tylenol 1000 milligrams and oxycodone?  

21      A.  Yeah.  

22      Q.  And was the idea that you'd go across the street to 

23  the hospital to get the oxycodone?  

24      A.  Yeah.  They wheeled me over there to get the 

25  medication, and they said that they would call it into the 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     77

 1  Albertsons pharmacy.  

 2      Q.  Did they then wheel you back to your car?  

 3      A.  Yeah.  They brought me -- at that time I was at the 

 4  hospital, itself, across the street from Cascade, and they 

 5  wheeled me down in front, and that's where my wife had 

 6  pulled up and picked me up.  

 7      Q.  Who was it that wheeled you up to the hospital for 

 8  the medications?  

 9      A.  It was somebody from Cascade, the office where I had 

10  the procedure done at.  

11      Q.  Cascades East?  

12      A.  Yeah, Cascades East.  

13      Q.  Not Rene, but somebody else?  

14      A.  No.  It was not Rene.  It was somebody else.  

15      Q.  Did you have any discussion with that person about 

16  how things had gone during the vasectomy?  

17      A.  No.  

18      Q.  Do you remember being given a semen or a 

19  sperm-collection container?  

20      A.  Correct.  

21      Q.  And instructions that you needed to do certain 

22  things before you had a semen check in three months.  

23          Do you remember that?  

24      A.  I don't remember having to do anything.  

25      Q.  But it says, "The patient was instructed to achieve 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     78

 1  20 ejaculations before the semen check in three months."  

 2          Do you have a memory of something like that?  

 3      A.  Yeah.  

 4      Q.  All right.  That's fine.  And your understanding, 

 5  then, was that the next thing -- if everything went fine -- 

 6  that you would need do is you'd need to come back in three 

 7  months to have that semen check?  

 8      A.  Correct.  

 9      Q.  Did you interact with anybody else at Cascades East 

10  that I haven't asked you about from the time the vasectomy 

11  ended until the time you left?  

12      A.  No.  

13      Q.  Okay.  Have you told me everything that you can 

14  recall Dr. Peters saying to you about the vasectomy 

15  procedure and what had occurred during the vasectomy 

16  procedure before you left the office that day?  

17      A.  Not that -- I believe I've said everything he said 

18  that day.  

19      Q.  All right.  So you were wheeled up to the hospital 

20  to get medications, and then you were wheeled back down to 

21  Cascades East where your wife was waiting?  

22      A.  She was -- actually, she pulled up in front of the 

23  hospital.  We never actually came back to Cascades East, 

24  because they wheeled me out of Cascades East over to the 

25  pharmacy at the hospital, and they were having a difficulty 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     79

 1  trying to get the prescription.  

 2          So they told me they would just call it into 

 3  Albertsons; that way I could start heading home.  And my 

 4  wife took me home, and she went back to Albertsons and got 

 5  the medication.  But they wheeled me out of the hospital, 

 6  down to in front of the hospital, and that's where they 

 7  helped me get into my vehicle.  

 8      Q.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I got it.  

 9      A.  Yeah.  

10      Q.  Not that it matters.  

11          Okay.  So she had been waiting to pick you up at 

12  Cascades East, and then when you were wheeled up to the 

13  hospital, where you went to the pharmacy, she then drove up 

14  to the hospital across the street, up the hill, and then 

15  picked you up there?  

16      A.  Yeah.  I called her as soon as they wheeled me out 

17  of Cascades East with my cell phone and told her they are 

18  taking me to the hospital to get me medication and to pick 

19  me up out front.  I believe at that time she was at home, 

20  still waiting for me, because she had already waited in the 

21  parking lot so long that she had to leave to take my kids to 

22  the house to use the bathroom and stuff like that, because 

23  it was just taking so long.  

24      Q.  And I'll have a chance to ask her questions this 

25  afternoon.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     80

 1          But, to your knowledge, did she have a discussions 

 2  with either Dr. Smith or Dr. Peters that day about any 

 3  update on how the procedure had been going?  

 4      A.  I do not believe that she spoke with Dr. Peters and 

 5  Dr. Smith.  

 6      Q.  Okay.  Or any other staff member giving you any sort 

 7  of an update?  

 8      A.  I believe that she had called on the status of me, 

 9  and they had told her that they were just having 

10  difficulties, so -- 

11      Q.  Do you remember anything else about that?  

12      A.  I don't.  

13      Q.  So she picked you up at the hospital.  

14          At the time she picked you up at the hospital to 

15  leave, were you experiencing any pain?  

16      A.  Correct.  

17      Q.  Where?  

18      A.  In my scrotum.  

19      Q.  Was the pain in a different location or the same 

20  location as it had been during the procedure itself?  

21      A.  Everything was so bandaged up and everything, I just 

22  knew that it was -- it felt like my left testicle was being 

23  squished, and it was hurting bad.  

24      Q.  On a scale of one to ten, zero being no pain, ten 

25  being off the charts, the highest pain possible, can you 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     81

 1  give me some sort of scale at the time you got in the car 

 2  with your wife to leave?  

 3      A.  A ten for sure.  

 4      Q.  It was ten out of ten?  

 5      A.  Oh, yeah.  There was no doubt about it.  I could 

 6  hardly walk.  

 7      Q.  Was the pain ten out of ten when the vasectomy 

 8  procedure was ended, but you were still in the vasectomy 

 9  room with Dr. Peters?  

10      A.  Towards the end it was a ten.  Towards the end of 

11  the procedure, it was definitely a ten; I hurt so bad.  

12      Q.  It sounds like, at the time you left the vasectomy 

13  room, you were having ten out of ten pain?  

14      A.  Yeah.  It wasn't until I got off that hospital bed 

15  and felt the ground with my feet and tried to walk, that I 

16  realized I was hurting so bad, I couldn't walk.  

17      Q.  Was is it your memory that the pain at that point 

18  was in your left testicle?  

19      A.  I remember that it was in my testicles, but -- in my 

20  scrotum, but it felt more -- more in, like, my left side of 

21  my testicles.  

22      Q.  Did it radiate anywhere outside your scrotum?  

23      A.  No.  

24      Q.  Was there any discussion, before you left 

25  Cascades East on the day of the vasectomy, about the 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     82

 1  incisions themselves?  

 2      A.  Can you say that again.  

 3      Q.  Sure.  Before you left Cascades East on the day of 

 4  the vasectomy, was there any discussion with anybody -- 

 5  Dr. Smith, Dr. Peters -- anybody about the incisions that 

 6  had been performed during your procedure?  

 7      A.  There was nothing said about any incisions, about 

 8  any of the incisions.  

 9      Q.  Okay.  All right.  So did you folks go straight home 

10  after your wife picked you up at the hospital?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  I can check the calendar.  Was that a Friday?  

13      A.  Yes.  

14      Q.  Were you scheduled to work at all on Saturday or 

15  Sunday?  

16      A.  No.  

17      Q.  Was it your plan, going into it, that you were just 

18  going to lay low and use ice and do those things on Saturday 

19  and Sunday to try to recover?  

20      A.  Correct.  

21      Q.  Do you remember anything happening with regard to 

22  your physical condition on Friday before you went to bed 

23  Friday night?  

24      A.  Anything happening?  

25      Q.  Yeah.  That was kind of a broad question.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     83

 1      A.  Yeah.  

 2      Q.  So once you got home --  

 3      A.  Yeah.  

 4      Q.  -- for the remainder of the day on Friday, did 

 5  anything change with regard to your scrotum, your testicles, 

 6  the feelings you were experiencing?  

 7      A.  Just swelling.  I know that he told me to lay flat 

 8  on my bed, keep my feet elevated, take a towel, push it up 

 9  underneath to help support it, you know; and then just ice 

10  it as needed.  Just stay off your feet and just ice it as 

11  needed.  

12      Q.  Did you do those things Friday?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Did you get any pain relief at all on Friday?  

15      A.  The pain medication helped, for sure, but there was 

16  a constant throbbing and pounding that was going on that I 

17  didn't quite understand what it was.  

18      Q.  Same location?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  Did you go anywhere Friday afternoon-Friday evening 

21  or just stay home?  

22      A.  No.  I stayed home, yeah.  

23      Q.  Were you able to sleep at all that night?  

24      A.  Yeah.  

25      Q.  So why don't you tell me, then, about Saturday.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     84

 1          What happened on Saturday?  

 2      A.  Saturday?  I believe is the day I tried to take a 

 3  shower.  Yeah.  

 4      Q.  And what happened?  

 5      A.  Well, at this point I have no idea what had happened 

 6  down there.  I've never -- I didn't look at it.  I didn't -- 

 7  anything.  So, it's the first time removing the gauze and 

 8  the jock strap and all that stuff and getting in to take a 

 9  shower.  

10          So, at that point is when I -- before I got out of 

11  bed, I remember seeing a lot of blood all over the towel 

12  that was supporting my groin.  So I -- I got in to take a 

13  shower, and I got in, and I'm taking my shower and stuff, 

14  and just kind of looking around, and I noticed the incision 

15  in the front, and -- and then I'm washing, and then I could 

16  feel something on the back left side.  

17          And I started looking, and it -- it was definitely a 

18  big incision or tear, or it was something more than I 

19  thought was going on, because I had no idea that I had more 

20  than one cut at all.  At no point did I hear anybody say 

21  they were cutting multiple times, or anything was any 

22  different.  So I didn't know.  

23      Q.  Did you notice anything else?  

24      A.  Just the swelling and the bleeding.  

25      Q.  So I have photographs that were provided by your 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     85

 1  attorney.  It looked like they were taken on an iPhone, and 

 2  they are dated April 11.  

 3          So that would have been on Sunday?  

 4      A.  Yeah.  

 5      Q.  And they appear to show an area on your scrotum of 

 6  an incision or a cut or something?  

 7      A.  Yeah.  

 8      Q.  Do you remember having those pictures taken?  

 9      A.  Yeah.  

10      Q.  Do you -- was that the first time that you noticed 

11  that area?  

12      A.  Yeah.  So, it was -- so, I don't know if I took the 

13  shower Saturday or Sunday.  I think it was Sunday, then, is 

14  what it was.  It's been so long.  

15      Q.  Sorry.  Was the purpose in taking those photographs 

16  to photograph that area that you had discovered?  

17      A.  Yeah.  Well, I wanted her to show me what it looked 

18  like, because I couldn't really see with the angle.  So I 

19  asked her to take some pictures so I could, actually, see 

20  what it looks like, because I couldn't really get down, 

21  around to the back-left side to the back there.  

22      Q.  Okay.  So, do you remember anything else happening 

23  for the remainder of that weekend, with regard to your 

24  scrotum, your testicles, your physical condition?  

25      A.  No.  Just trying to keep ice and take my medication 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     86

 1  and relax.  I didn't do anything.  I didn't get out of bed 

 2  except to use the bathroom.  

 3      Q.  Did you reach out and receive any sort of advice or 

 4  any sort of medical care with anybody that weekend?  

 5      A.  No.  

 6      Q.  So, then, Monday came around; that would have been 

 7  April 12th.  

 8          April 12th, do you remember anything happening on 

 9  Monday, the Monday after your vasectomy?  

10      A.  Well, I called my boss and told them, "I can't take 

11  the job in California" and that I could hardly walk.  

12          And he told me, "Take all the time you need."  He 

13  said, "I'm truly sorry."

14      Q.  And so you did not go to work on Monday?  

15      A.  No.  

16      Q.  When was the next time you went back to work for any 

17  purpose?  I realize maybe it wasn't for a full work, but 

18  when was the last time -- when was the next time you showed 

19  up to work in any capacity?  Do you remember?  

20      A.  I believe it was couple months later.  

21      Q.  All right.  I'm going to have a lot more questions 

22  about your work.  At least for now, tell me what you 

23  remember about not being able to take the job in California.  

24          What does that mean?  

25      A.  It was a high-scale prevailing wage project.  I just 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     87

 1  make a lot more money doing those kind of -- taking on the 

 2  State and federal jobs, doing sidewalks, and ADA ramps, and 

 3  things like that is usually what I specialize in, doing 

 4  sidewalks for Rocky Mountain Construction.  And we had a big 

 5  project in Northern California that year; that was supposed 

 6  to be my project, and I wasn't -- I wasn't able to make that 

 7  project.  

 8      Q.  So were you supposed to leave town on Monday after 

 9  your vasectomy and go to Northern California?  

10      A.  It was in Dorris, but, yeah.  Yes, yep.  

11      Q.  So you were supposed to go down to Dorris.  

12          Do you remember how long you were supposed to be in 

13  Dorris?  

14      A.  I believe it was a two-to-three-month project, but I 

15  would be home every night with my family.  

16      Q.  Dorris is how many -- 

17      A.  30 minutes --  

18      Q.  Yeah.  

19      A.  -- from my house.  

20      Q.  Got it.  So the plan was that you would be working 

21  on the project in Dorris for two to three months, and that 

22  would require you to commute from here to Dorris, 30 minutes 

23  each way?  

24      A.  Correct.  

25      Q.  All right.  So the next record I have of any medical 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     88

 1  care you received was on April 18th when you returned to see 

 2  Dr. Peters for a follow-up.  

 3          Is that consistent with your memory?  

 4      A.  I believe so.  There was a couple times I went up 

 5  there, and he would Super Glue or put butterfly stitches on 

 6  the large incision, but --

 7      Q.  Let me ask you this:  Do you recall seeing any 

 8  medical care provider between the time you left your 

 9  vasectomy procedure and then going back and seeing 

10  Dr. Peters for the first time?  

11      A.  No.  

12      Q.  Nobody in between; right?  

13      A.  No.  

14      Q.  So, then, when you went back to see Dr. Peters for 

15  the first time after your vasectomy, did you go by yourself, 

16  or did somebody go with you?  

17      A.  By myself.  

18      Q.  Okay.  And I'll just represent to you that 

19  Dr. Peters noted that you reported fairly severe scrotal 

20  pain on the left side?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  He reported that you noticed a skin tear in the 

23  posterior of the back of the scrotum that --  

24      A.  Yes.  

25      Q.  -- you thought was painful; is that accurate?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     89

 1      A.  Correct, yes.  

 2      Q.  Do you remember what Dr. Peters told you about that 

 3  area of your scrotum?  

 4      A.  I don't.  I don't recall word-for-word what he said 

 5  about it.  

 6      Q.  Did he tell you how it occurred?  

 7      A.  He did not.  

 8      Q.  Did you ask him?  

 9      A.  No, I didn't.  I don't remember asking him how the 

10  lacerations -- or whatever they are called -- I never asked 

11  him, because I just assumed that he used, you know, a sharp 

12  object in order to --  

13      Q.  Dr. Peters report that had you were taking ibuprofen 

14  and oxycodone daily?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  You were also using ice; is that true?  

17      A.  He told me to use ice.  I used ice when the swelling 

18  was going on.  

19      Q.  Okay.  Tell me what Dr. Peters told you, at that 

20  very first visit, about what was going on?  

21      A.  He said that he's -- he said he was truly sorry for, 

22  you know, taking so long and everything, when I showed him, 

23  and he just said that he hopes -- he wants to "help me get 

24  through this nightmare" that he caused me was what he told 

25  me.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     90

 1      Q.  Were those words that he used?  

 2      A.  Yes.  

 3      Q.  Is it your memory that he said that at your first 

 4  visit with him after?  

 5      A.  I don't remember if it was my first or second visit 

 6  afterwards, but he did tell me that.  

 7      Q.  Okay.  His note from that first visit mentions that, 

 8  "The vasectomy was complicated by significant scar tissue on 

 9  the left."

10          Do you remember having any discussion with him about 

11  that?  

12      A.  He said something about scar tissue.  

13      Q.  And then his note reflects that it appeared to him 

14  that, in the process of trying to locate the anatomy on that 

15  left side, that there was a skin tear that happened.  

16          Do you remember him saying anything about that?  

17      A.  I don't remember him saying anything about the skin 

18  tear.  

19      Q.  Okay.  Do you remember anything else at all about 

20  anything he told you at that first visit when you came back 

21  to see him?  

22      A.  He just told me that he wished he'd stopped 

23  dissecting on me shortly after he started is what he said to 

24  me.  

25      Q.  Can you tell me, to the very best of your 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     91

 1  recollection, what he said about that?  

 2      A.  He said he never meant to cause me any harm.  

 3      Q.  And did you appreciate him expressing those words to 

 4  you?  

 5      A.  I did.  I looked him right in the eye, as a man, and 

 6  told him, you know, "Help me get through this now," you 

 7  know.  "That's all I want."

 8      Q.  Was he responsive to that?  

 9      A.  Yeah.  

10      Q.  Do you remember anything else he said to you about 

11  that?  

12      A.  Just that he was -- he was going to help me try to 

13  get through this, you know.  

14      Q.  Okay.  All right.  And this note indicates there was 

15  some discussion about medications and then follow-up as 

16  needed.  There's a note in the record from April 29th, at 

17  the end of that month, by Dr. Peters that he received a call 

18  from you at about 9:30 at night on his personal cell phone.  

19          You called him about vasectomy pain?  

20      A.  Correct.  

21      Q.  Do you remember doing that?  

22      A.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  

23      Q.  I take it Dr. Peters had given you his personal cell 

24  phone?  

25      A.  Yes.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     92

 1      Q.  Do you remember when he did that?  

 2      A.  At the initial vasectomy, he gave it to me.  I 

 3  believe it was -- it -- I believe he gave it to me -- I 

 4  can't remember if it was at the vasectomy or my first visit, 

 5  when he actually first seen me and seen I couldn't hardly 

 6  walk still.  He expressed his concern, and he gave me his 

 7  number, I think, just to comfort me and pretty much tell me, 

 8  "If there's anything you need, call me.  You know, it's, 

 9  like, I'll help you get through this."

10      Q.  All right.  

11      A.  I can't -- I don't believe it was actually at the 

12  vasectomy, like the very first procedure, because the way it 

13  ended so fast and abrupt, that it wasn't -- there was no 

14  conversation, really, at the end, so -- 

15      Q.  It sounds like your best recollection is at that 

16  first postop visit?  

17      A.  Yeah, when I seen him and got to talk to him.  

18      Q.  Did you appreciate him giving you his personal cell 

19  phone?  

20      A.  Yes.  

21      Q.  So you, then, called him that night.  

22          What was it about?  What was going on that night 

23  that prompted you to make the phone call?  

24      A.  Just, I needed more medication.  I hurt bad, and the 

25  medication wasn't -- wasn't -- like, wasn't enough, and I 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     93

 1  needed more than just ibuprofen, and I needed more pain 

 2  medication to help me.  

 3      Q.  Okay.  Did Dr. Peters express to you that he would 

 4  help you do that?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  Was the pain any different by that point?  So 

 7  April 29th, when you called the cell phone, was it any 

 8  different, in terms of location or feeling, than it had been 

 9  before?  

10      A.  As to when I left the procedure, everything was more 

11  like numb, and as the numbness wore off and the days went 

12  on, it was more and more of just a throbbing and pounding 

13  and tingling sensation that would not go away.  

14      Q.  Was it throughout your scrotum?  

15      A.  Throughout my scrotum, mainly on the left side.  The 

16  back left side is what hurt so "fricking" bad.  

17      Q.  The back left side of the testicle or the scrotum?  

18      A.  The scrotum.  

19      Q.  Was that basically the location where that skin tear 

20  or that area you took the photograph was?  

21      A.  Correct.  I at no point had any pain in the front.  

22  The front incision, the one that was underneath, I didn't 

23  have any pain there.  I never felt any pain there.  All the 

24  pain was in the far back left side.  

25      Q.  Was the skin tear or the incision, or whatever it 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     94

 1  was on the back of the left side of the scrotum, was that 

 2  itself painful?  If you were to touch the -- that area, was 

 3  it painful?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  Okay.  

 6      A.  Very, very painful.  When you walk and it touches 

 7  your leg, it hurts bad.  

 8      Q.  It sounds like you were also having pain on the 

 9  right side, but the pain on the left was worse; is that 

10  right?  

11      A.  Yeah, yeah.  I felt the right pain more when they 

12  removed three quarters of my scrotum, during that surgery, 

13  that my testicle was not in the position it naturally is -- 

14  it's more like this and pushed up tight -- did I start 

15  really feeling pain in my right testicle, and that was just 

16  last year when that started hurting.  

17      Q.  You just showed me about your hand.  Was that a 

18  description of your right testicles?  

19      A.  Both of my testicles --  

20      Q.  Yeah.  

21      A.  -- when they are relaxed, but yet when -- it feels 

22  like, when three quarters, or however much of my scrotum was 

23  removed, to try to take that topical pain away from the 

24  tears, when -- it feels like that testicle was removed, and 

25  then I was left with my right one low, and when they removed 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     95

 1  that scrotum, it feels like my testicle was laying like this 

 2  against my penis, goes over there, but it's so tight and 

 3  pushed tight that it hurts sitting, riding -- anything, but 

 4  I'm getting used to it.  

 5      Q.  Just for the written record, you were describing it 

 6  looked like the right testicle turned on itself and went up 

 7  higher, rode higher.  

 8          Is that basically what you were describing?  

 9      A.  Yeah, due to the -- having the scrotum surgery.  

10      Q.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So it looks like you 

11  had some additional contact with Dr. Peters in early May 

12  about pain relief and then a discussion with Dr. Peters 

13  about being referred for an evaluation or a second opinion 

14  from somebody else.  

15          Do you remember having a discussion with Dr. Peters 

16  about that?  

17      A.  I did.  

18      Q.  Okay.  And then it looks like there's a text message 

19  exchange on May 9th.  You reported in a text message that 

20  you had an appointment with Dr. Raul Mirande?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  Do you remember that?  

23          And I think -- was that an appointment that you or 

24  your wife found for you on your own?  

25      A.  I think I found it on my own.  I was just trying to 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     96

 1  find somebody else who does vasectomies and who can give me 

 2  a second opinion, because Dr. Peters, himself, was the one 

 3  that told me, "I think you need to get a second opinion, 

 4  Chris."

 5      Q.  Did he give you a name at that point?  

 6      A.  He just said that there's people in town that, 

 7  actually, do vasectomies and that I should probably look 

 8  into it.  At that point I told my boss and guys at work, and 

 9  a buddy of mine at work had told me that he actually went to 

10  Rogue Valley Urology and had Dr. Bui do one and that he's 

11  phenomenal, so that's where I went.  

12      Q.  Okay.  It looks like you texted about Dr. Mirande, 

13  and Dr. Peters followed up and said, "Okay.  Maybe I'll give 

14  you another name as well," and then you -- let's see.  You 

15  followed up again with Dr. Peters, and then you had an 

16  ultrasound of your scrotum and your testicles on May 9th.  

17          Do you remember having that?  

18      A.  I do, yes.  

19      Q.  Was that an ultrasound that was ordered by 

20  Dr. Peters?  

21      A.  Yes.  

22      Q.  What did you learn about the results of the 

23  ultrasound?  

24      A.  He just -- I think they were looking for any kind 

25  of, like, infection or maybe anything that was out of the 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     97

 1  ordinary.  I'm not sure exactly what they were looking for, 

 2  but from what I understood, everything looked fine.  

 3      Q.  It looks like the same day -- yeah -- Dr. Peters 

 4  then made a formal referral for you to see Dr. Mirande?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  And the next day you texted that you called 

 7  Dr. Bui's office, and you were going to schedule an 

 8  appointment with Dr. Bui as well.  

 9          Does that sound, basically, consistent with your 

10  recollection?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  So it looks like a couple of days later, then, you 

13  were able to be seen by Dr. Mirande?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  Did you go to that visit on your own?  

16      A.  Yes.  

17      Q.  Tell me what you remember about your visit with 

18  Dr. Mirande.  

19      A.  He informed me right away that he was, I believe, a 

20  nerve and vein specialist, but that he did do vasectomies, 

21  but like he's more specialized in nerves and veins, I 

22  believe.  

23      Q.  Okay.  Did he perform a physical exam?  

24      A.  I can't remember if he had, actually, had done a 

25  physical exam on me and looked at everything or if he just 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     98

 1  told me that, "Sometimes there are difficulties."  Because I 

 2  remember him saying that the -- "Chris, sometimes there are 

 3  difficulties," because probably with the way I was walking 

 4  and my state of mobility; it was hard to walk around and 

 5  move around at that time.  

 6      Q.  Okay.  

 7      A.  So I don't remember.  I know that Dr. Bui had did -- 

 8  looked at everything, but I don't remember if Miranda did or 

 9  not.  

10      Q.  I'll represent to you that Dr. Mirande's note did 

11  say his exam showed "a well-healed vasectomy incision in the 

12  middle of the scrotum and a separate left-sided -- large 

13  left-sided wound that was granulating, but no drainage."

14      A.  Okay.  

15      Q.  Does that refresh your memory about Dr. Mirande?  

16      A.  Yeah, I mean, now that you say that, but I don't, 

17  physically, remember Miranda doing it.  I don't.  

18      Q.  Just tell me everything you remember Dr. Mirande 

19  saying to you at that visit about anything?  

20      A.  He told me that, "Sometimes there are difficulties 

21  in doing procedures like this."  I remember him saying that, 

22  but I don't remember a whole lot that I had talked to him 

23  about, really.  He mainly told me -- what I got of it was 

24  that I needed to see a urologist, somebody who specializes 

25  in what was going on.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                     99

 1          So when I walked out of there, it was kind of just 

 2  like a, "I need to go elsewhere" type thing.  Like not that 

 3  I wasn't welcome, but it was like -- more like, you know, 

 4  it's not -- he didn't really seem like he was interested in 

 5  helping me, but yet, kind of, just telling me to -- that I 

 6  needed to look elsewhere, like, for a urologist.  

 7      Q.  His note indicates that he mentioned there was no 

 8  indication for more surgery; although maybe there was an 

 9  option for a testicle removal.  

10          Do you remember anything about that?  

11      A.  I don't.  

12      Q.  Okay.  It sounds like you got the impression that 

13  any follow-up needed to be from somebody other than 

14  Dr. Mirande?  

15      A.  It was pretty much like that.  It was a very quick 

16  visit, and I don't -- I didn't feel like I got anything out 

17  of it.  

18      Q.  Okay.  

19      A.  Like -- so -- 

20      Q.  Have you seen Dr. Mirande since that visit?  

21      A.  No.  

22      Q.  The records indicate that you went back to see 

23  Dr. Peters.  About five days after your visit with 

24  Dr. Mirande, you went back to see Dr. Peters on May 16th.  

25          Do you remember doing that?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    100

 1      A.  I -- 

 2      Q.  Actually, I'm sorry.  That was a phone encounter; 

 3  that was phone.  

 4      A.  Phone encounter?  

 5      Q.  Yeah.  

 6      A.  I remember there was several times, throughout the, 

 7  you know, first couple months, of whether it's phone or 

 8  visits with Dr. Peters for sure.  

 9      Q.  Dr. Peters' note about that phone encounter on the 

10  16th said that day was your first day back at work, and you 

11  were on light duty?  

12      A.  Is that June?  

13      Q.  That was May 16th.  

14      A.  May 16th?  

15      Q.  What he said about it:  "Today is his first day back 

16  to work on light duty -- reading plans, directing job site, 

17  not planning to work machinery for another two weeks."  I 

18  don't know if that refreshes your memory at all.  

19      A.  Yeah.  I remember when I did go back, I didn't jump 

20  right into machines and stuff like that.  It was more of a 

21  supervise, project manager at that point, less not 

22  operating.  

23      Q.  Had your pain changed in any way, location or 

24  severity?  

25      A.  No.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    101

 1      Q.  You were continuing to take pain medication?  

 2      A.  Correct.  

 3      Q.  Including the prescribed oxycodone?  

 4      A.  Correct.  I was unable to operate while I was taking 

 5  it.  

 6      Q.  Okay.  And then it looks like, according to the 

 7  records, that Dr. Peters filled out a referral for you to go 

 8  and see Dr. Bui over in Medford?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  You went to see Dr. Bui for the first time on 

11  May 20, 2022?  

12      A.  Correct.  

13      Q.  I presume that was you going to Medford --  

14      A.  Yeah.  

15      Q.  -- is that right?  

16          When you saw Dr. Bui for the first time, did you go 

17  by yourself, or did your wife go you with?  

18      A.  I went by myself.  

19      Q.  What do you remember about your visit with Dr. Bui 

20  for the first time?  

21      A.  I just -- like when I walked in and I seen him and 

22  he evaluated me and just, like, what he said or like -- I 

23  don't understand exactly -- 

24      Q.  Fair enough.  I appreciate it.  

25      A.  Yeah.  Because I don't want to say a bunch of -- you 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    102

 1  know what I mean?  I want to be specific on what we're 

 2  talking about but -- 

 3      Q.  You bet.  Yeah.  Thanks for clarifying.  

 4      A.  Yeah.  

 5      Q.  When you went so see Dr. Bui for the first time, I 

 6  presume that you went back into an examination room?  

 7      A.  Correct.  

 8      Q.  Did Dr. Bui take a history from you and find out 

 9  what was going on that was bringing you in?  

10      A.  Yeah, yeah, he did.  He questioned me on everything 

11  that had happened and things that I've been through --  

12      Q.  Okay.  

13      A.  -- following the procedure.  

14      Q.  Okay.  So after he took that history and found out 

15  what had been going on, do you remember him, then, doing a 

16  physical examination and taking a look and seeing what was 

17  going on?  

18      A.  I want to tell you that I think I got Dr. Bui and 

19  Dr. Mirande mixed up on that first visit, because I don't 

20  think Dr. Bui was able to look at everything.  I think 

21  Dr. Bui told me -- now that I remember -- "It's going to be 

22  at least four months before I could even get in there and do 

23  anything.  I need you to heal."  

24          And I don't believe I was correct.  I think that -- 

25  I remember Miranda looking.  I knew one of them did.  I just 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    103

 1  couldn't remember, but now that I'm remembering my visit 

 2  with Dr. Bui, I think I remember saying -- being surprised 

 3  that he didn't look at it.  

 4      Q.  Thank you for clarifying that.  

 5      A.  Because I -- I mixed the two up, and I apologize for 

 6  that.  

 7      Q.  I appreciate that clarification.  It does look like, 

 8  according to Dr. Bui's record, he doesn't document a 

 9  physical exam.  

10      A.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now that I'm remembering, 

11  concentrating on that, I remember thinking like he just 

12  looked at the way I was walking and trying to get into his 

13  office, and he just told me, "Hey, there's nothing I can do 

14  for at least four months before I could get in there, so 

15  things need to heal up in order for me to be able to do 

16  anything," so -- yeah.  

17      Q.  Yeah.  And his notes reflects that he says, "It 

18  could be a form of radiculopathy or possibly something 

19  called epididymidis, too soon to explore."

20      A.  Correct.  That's when he prescribed me -- he asked 

21  me if I had an infection or anything, and I said, "No, not 

22  that I knew of."  

23          And he goes, "I'm surprised it hasn't been brought 

24  up.  Have you taken any antibiotics?"  

25          I said, "No."  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    104

 1          He goes, "Well, I'm going to write you a scrip for 

 2  antibiotics, and I want you to take it, and hopefully --" we 

 3  were praying and hoping that that was the problem; maybe I 

 4  had a minor infection.  So I did -- I believe it was, like, 

 5  a 30-day course of antibiotics to try to kill anything, if 

 6  there was something else that was causing the pain, to avoid 

 7  any type of surgery.  So, at that point he prescribed me a 

 8  antibiotic that I took.  That's right.  

 9      Q.  Do you remember anything else about that initial 

10  visit with Dr. Bui?  

11      A.  I don't.  

12      Q.  And it looks like, afterwards, you followed up with 

13  Dr. Peters on the phone; you two had a phone encounters --  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  -- and some text messages?  

16          So then it looks like, according to the records, you 

17  went back to see Dr. Bui for a second time on June 24th of 

18  2022?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  Does that sound consistent with your memory?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  Was that another occasion where you drove over to 

23  Medford?  

24      A.  Yes.  

25      Q.  For a scheduled appointment with him?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    105

 1      A.  Yes.  

 2      Q.  Did your wife go with you on that occasion?  

 3      A.  No -- or -- no, I don't believe so.  

 4      Q.  So let me just -- I'll make some references to his 

 5  records and see if this refreshes your recollection.  I'll 

 6  represent to you that in his record Dr. Bui mentioned, at 

 7  the June 24, 2022 visit, that you had "severe pain, left 

 8  more than the right"?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  Okay.  Is that accurate with how you were doing?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  You were taking NSAIDs or, like, ibuprofen-type 

13  medication, still having severe pain, ten out of ten, 

14  especially on the left?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  You had an ultrasound on May 9th of 2022 that he 

17  showed -- he said showed left epididymitis?  

18      A.  Correct.  

19      Q.  Do you remember hearing words like that?  

20      A.  Yes.  

21      Q.  Dr. Bui mentioned that the right side was also 

22  sensitive to the touch?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  Is that accurate?  

25      A.  Yes.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    106

 1      Q.  Dr. Bui mentioned that you wanted surgical 

 2  intervention because conservative measures with medication 

 3  and elevating the scrotum had not helped?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  He, again -- Dr. Bui -- mentioned that you may be 

 6  having a form of radiculopathy or possibly epididymitis.  

 7          Do you remember him using words like that?  

 8      A.  Correct.  

 9      Q.  And he said, "It's still too soon to explore"?  

10      A.  Correct.  

11      Q.  Do you remember him telling you that?  

12      A.  Yes.  

13      Q.  Okay.  Do you remember -- and he said, "We'll do a 

14  follow-up to see if the pain is any better.  Patient also 

15  hurts on the right."  

16          Sounds like you do remember that?  

17      A.  Yeah.  

18      Q.  Okay.  And then Dr. Bui said, "The patient opted for 

19  a bilateral epididymectomy as the right side is also 

20  sensitive and painful."

21      A.  Correct.  When he -- when you feel it, you could 

22  feel it when you touch the right side too.  It was also 

23  hurting, and it felt like, to me, his concern was that, "If 

24  we take out the left side and we leave the right, you'll 

25  still have pain.  We could eliminate it by removing them 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    107

 1  both."  

 2      Q.  Did you understand, by removing them both, was he 

 3  referring to the tubes that run into the testicles?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  So, the idea there was:  We'll remove those areas to 

 6  both the right and the left, to see if that helps?  

 7      A.  Correct.  

 8      Q.  And then it looks like you had that procedure three 

 9  days later?  

10      A.  Correct.  

11      Q.  June 27th.  Was that a procedure he was able to 

12  perform in the office, or did you have to go to the hospital 

13  for that?  

14      A.  I -- I went in -- I believe it was the surgery 

15  center.  

16      Q.  In Medford?  

17      A.  Yes.  

18      Q.  How long were you there, if you remember?  

19      A.  They put me under in the morning time and then did 

20  the surgery, and then I don't remember exactly when I woke 

21  up.  And then I had somebody take me back to Klamath Falls.  

22      Q.  Do you remember who it was that took you back?  

23      A.  I'm trying to remember, because I had one of my 

24  bosses take me over for a surgery, and I know I had another 

25  friend take me over for a surgery, and I've had my wife take 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    108

 1  me over one time for a surgery.  

 2      Q.  Who is the boss that took you over?  

 3      A.  Jerry Green at Rocky Mountain Construction.  

 4      Q.  Is that Jerry, J-e-r-r-y?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  And Green, is it G-r-e-e-n. 

 7      A.  Correct. 

 8      Q.  Okay.  Is he still at Rocky Mountain Construction?  

 9      A.  Yes.  

10      Q.  Who was the friend that did that as well?  

11      A.  Mike Hamilton.  

12      Q.  Did you say Mike Hamilton?  

13      A.  Yes.  

14      Q.  Is he also with Rocky Mountain Construction?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  And he still there?  

17      A.  Yes.  And I have another one, too, Al Pranghofer.  

18      Q.  P-r-a-n-g-h-o-f-f-e-r(sic)?  

19      A.  I believe so.  

20      Q.  At Rocky Mountain Construction?  

21      A.  At Rocky Mountain Construction.  

22      Q.  Still there?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  Did Dr. Bui tell you about any complications at all 

25  that he encountered in that bilateral epididymectomy?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    109

 1      A.  Just that he told me that things were cut up pretty 

 2  good in there, and it was kind of hard to identify it, some 

 3  of the things.  

 4      Q.  Do you remember anything else he told you about what 

 5  he saw?  

 6      A.  I don't.  He -- when he explained it to me, it's 

 7  kind of like -- he said, "You're a hunter.  You know what a 

 8  bloodshot deer looks like.  It's kind of like -- you know, 

 9  that's why I can't get in there and do it because this -- 

10  from what had happened, we need to wait and let everything 

11  heal before we -- to get in there."  But what he -- about 

12  what he's talking about what he saw when he got there, he 

13  just said that things were pretty chopped up.  

14      Q.  Pretty chopped up?  

15      A.  Yeah.  

16      Q.  That's what you took from what he described?  

17      A.  That's what I took from what he described, yes. 

18      Q.  Did Dr. Bui, either at that point or ever -- did he 

19  ever express any criticisms of Dr. Peters and Dr. Smith?  

20      A.  There was just one point where he just said that, 

21  "He should have known to sew you up and put in a referral to 

22  see a surgeon."

23      Q.  Are those, essentially, words he used?  

24      A.  Yes.  

25      Q.  Do you remember when he told you this?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    110

 1      A.  Just when -- when he seen me, so I don't remember if 

 2  it was -- I think it was the first visit.  Yep.  

 3      Q.  Do you remember anything else that he expressed to 

 4  you in that regard?  

 5      A.  No.  

 6      Q.  Did you get any relief from the bilateral 

 7  epididymectomy from the first procedure Dr. Bui performed?  

 8      A.  I feel like I got -- in the beginning, no, I didn't 

 9  get any relief.  I felt like, if I got any, it was just 

10  minimal.  The only time I felt like I had relief was, like, 

11  before I returned to work.  I would start to feel better, 

12  thinking I'm doing better; I'm good to go.  I had no idea I 

13  was going to have more surgeries.  I thought this was the 

14  end of it.  Positive attitude:  "Let's get going.  Let's get 

15  back to work.  Let's make some money."  

16          And I get to work, and I can't.  I hurt.  I throb.  

17  I pound.  The sun is hot, and I'm wearing sweats and tennis 

18  shoes instead of work jeans and boots.  You know, everything 

19  I do, it just hurts so -- 

20      Q.  Okay.  Did you notice any change after the bilateral 

21  epididymectomy?  

22      A.  If there was, it was very minimal.  

23      Q.  It looks like you followed up with Dr. Bui about a 

24  month later, end of July --  

25      A.  Yes.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    111

 1      Q.  -- follow-up?  

 2          And said you're still having post-bilateral 

 3  epididymectomy pain; is that right?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  What he said in his note -- Dr. Bui -- on July 29th 

 6  was that, "The right-side pain had improved markedly, a lot; 

 7  the left was still very painful at times"?  

 8      A.  Correct.  

 9      Q.  Is that accurate?  

10      A.  Yeah.  

11      Q.  So you did get some relief on the right?  

12      A.  Yeah.  I think that, when he removed that stuff, I 

13  no longer felt any more of that tubular pain on the right to 

14  the touch.  

15      Q.  All right.  And then you had a telehealth visit with 

16  him in October, October 19th?  

17      A.  Correct.  

18      Q.  As a follow-up?  

19      A.  Yeah.  

20      Q.  Okay.  And I'll just tell you what he said in there 

21  is that, "The right was much better, but the left still 

22  remained tender to the touch and ten out of ten."  

23          Is that consistent with how you were feeling at the 

24  time?  

25      A.  Correct.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    112

 1      Q.  He indicated that, "There was no evidence of 

 2  infection."

 3          Do you remember that?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  And so then he said at that visit you wanted to 

 6  proceed with a left orchiectomy, or the removal of your left 

 7  testicle, with the understanding that the pain could still 

 8  remain if it's radiculopathy?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  Do you remember that discussion with him?  

11      A.  Yes.  

12      Q.  What do you remember about that discussion?  

13      A.  I just remember that, when he went to do the -- 

14  remove the cords and stuff, he didn't want to take the 

15  testicle at the same time in case it was the first 

16  procedure, and then I just remember telling him, "If there's 

17  a chance I could take this pain away by taking my testicle, 

18  then take it," because I wanted it gone, so -- 

19      Q.  So that was the next step after the bilateral 

20  epididymectomy?  

21      A.  Yeah, because it seemed like nobody really knew how 

22  to fix me.  Like Dr. Bui said, "There's so many microscopic 

23  nerves in there, we don't -- you know, I mean, that could be 

24  damaged, that we don't know if taking an epididymis, or 

25  whatever or your testicle, is going to be the solution, but 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    113

 1  these are things we could try."  

 2          And at that point I just wanted to -- I just wanted 

 3  to go back to work and play with my kids and go back to 

 4  normal.  So I'm willing to try anything; just fix me so -- 

 5      Q.  And is that, basically, what Dr. Bui told you about 

 6  what he thought was causing your pain is microscopic nerves 

 7  in the area?  

 8      A.  He said there could be a chance that that's what it 

 9  is.  So he -- he never said there was 100 percent guarantee 

10  that what he was going to do was going to fix me, but these 

11  are things that he felt like we should start with, so -- 

12      Q.  It looks like, for that procedure to remove your 

13  left testicle, that was performed at Providence Medford; is 

14  that right? 

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  And the records from there, Dr. Bui, again, 

17  mentioned "The right side pain is much better, but the left 

18  side has remained severe"?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  Dr. Bui, did he perform -- oh, he performed that 

21  procedure, then, on November 17th at the hospital?  

22      A.  Correct.  

23      Q.  Were you discharged from the hospital the same day?  

24      A.  Yes.  

25      Q.  Did Dr. Bui say anything to you about what he 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    114

 1  discovered during the process of removing your testicle?  

 2  Did he talk at all about that?  

 3      A.  There was just talk that research would be done on 

 4  it -- the testicle itself -- to see -- make sure there 

 5  wasn't like -- I don't know what he said -- maybe like a 

 6  disease or make sure there wasn't something else that wasn't 

 7  causing the pain outside of what we were -- the procedure.  

 8  You know, they take a look at it, make sure -- 

 9      Q.  Did you ever get a report back that there was any 

10  problem with the left testicle?  

11      A.  I believe it was -- it -- I believe he read that it 

12  was due to multiple lacerations and severe scarring to the 

13  left testicle is what it was.  

14      Q.  How did you get that information?  

15      A.  Because he read it to me in the -- over the phone 

16  when I was talking to him.  

17      Q.  Dr. Bui did?  

18      A.  Yeah.  

19      Q.  Did you get any relief from having your left 

20  testicle removed?  

21      A.  I felt a little bit; I did.  

22      Q.  How so?  

23      A.  I just felt like -- I felt like it was just a little 

24  bit less intense and not so severe.  Like, my heart rate 

25  picks up, where I start breathing heavy, or if I cough or 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    115

 1  anytime I, like, use my core muscles, then it starts 

 2  throbbing and feeling like a heartbeat inside of it; so I 

 3  think it was phantom pains for a while afterwards, but I 

 4  think that, after a few months, I started feeling like I was 

 5  getting a little bit -- felt a little bit better.  Like I 

 6  told Bui, I said, "Even if that surgery helped a little bit, 

 7  I feel like we're in the right direction," you know.  

 8      Q.  Yeah.  It looks like you had a telehealth post-visit 

 9  with Dr. Bui on December 21st of 2022.  

10          Do you remember having a telehealth visit with him?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  That was one month post-removal of your testicle, 

13  and Dr. Bui's note says, "Patient is post-left orchiectomy 

14  and is now doing great.  Pain is down to one out of ten, 

15  very happy with improvement."

16      A.  Correct.  

17      Q.  He said, "Pathology showed no abnormalities or 

18  infection."  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  "Patient feels somewhat lethargic, recommending 

21  getting his testosterone level checked with his PCP."  

22          Do you remember that?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  So, at that point, it sounds like there was some  

25  optimism; you were doing a lot better one out of ten, like 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    116

 1  the removal of your left testicle really helped?  

 2      A.  Yeah.  

 3      Q.  And it looks like you did follow-up with 

 4  Dr. Gonzales about having testing for your testosterone?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  What came of that?  Did you have low levels?  

 7      A.  Yeah.  It was like 109, my levels; so I asked her 

 8  what they were before.  They said they never tested them.  I 

 9  told them I didn't have any energy; I felt fatigued, tired.  

10  I don't know if it's from the surgeries or just laying 

11  around or medication.  But Dr. Bui said he felt like my 

12  testosterone level needed to be a lot higher than 245.  

13  That's when me and Erin Gonzales talked about getting me on 

14  replacements to help, kind of, kick me in the butt and get 

15  me going again.  

16      Q.  Did you do that?  

17      A.  Yes.  

18      Q.  Did that help?  

19      A.  Yes, it helped.  I take them every week, injections.  

20      Q.  Still doing that?  

21      A.  Yes.  

22      Q.  That helps your energy and things?  

23      A.  Yeah.  It helped me move around a lot.  

24      Q.  Okay.  So, then, I don't see -- I don't see a 

25  follow-up with Dr. Bui over the next several months.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    117

 1      A.  Yeah.  

 2      Q.  You had that follow-up visit one month after; things 

 3  were going great, and then it looks like there's a period of 

 4  time where there was no follow-up with Dr. Bui; is that 

 5  right?  

 6      A.  Correct.  

 7      Q.  And then in May you had an ultrasound of your 

 8  testicles.  

 9          Do you remember having an ultrasound at that point?  

10      A.  Correct.  

11      Q.  Why?  

12      A.  Just because the pain.  It's, like, I returned back 

13  to work, and everything started coming back again, like the 

14  pain, the throbbing, you know; so I would start to use heat 

15  to try to help with the pain instead of ice because I 

16  noticed that it was so sensitive to cold that heat seemed 

17  like the only thing that was helping with the pain, you 

18  know, and then taking my pain medication at night.  

19      Q.  When the pain came back, after the removal of your 

20  left testicle, where was it?  

21      A.  In that far back-left side of my scrotum.  

22      Q.  Was it on the external skin?  Was it internal?  

23  Could you tell?  

24      A.  It feels like both.  If you touched where the scar 

25  was and you touch it with your hands, it was really 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    118

 1  sensitive to the touch.  But then, if you reached up inside, 

 2  like if you came in from the right side and pushed up, you 

 3  could feel it on the inside too.  

 4          So I wasn't sure if it was when they took the 

 5  testicle itself, if it was pain that was -- how do I 

 6  describe it?  Like where the testicle used to sit, so now 

 7  that the testicle is gone, it felt like it was like inside 

 8  more, you know, not up top where the cords are, because it 

 9  almost felt when they removed my testicle, they pulled it 

10  down to cut it, and the cord went up.  

11          I could feel that different pain up there.  It went 

12  away.  It's gone.  I don't feel that up top.  It's just back 

13  where the testicle was from the initial procedure where 

14  those scars were, just -- just a little bit deep inside.  

15  Like I don't know if it was -- like, say this is the tissue, 

16  and it was on the tissue itself that they removed.  

17          But since they removed that scrotum, all of those 

18  scars -- all the touching to the outside is gone.  It's just 

19  on the inside and the nerves that hurt now, not so much the 

20  topical.  

21      Q.  Okay.  So you had a telehealth visit -- I think it's 

22  the next visit you had with Dr. Bui -- telehealth on 

23  June 9th of 2023.

24      A.  Yes.  

25      Q.  Does that sound right?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    119

 1      A.  Yes.  

 2      Q.  And Dr. Bui explained that, after having your left 

 3  testicle removed, you were now doing great.  "Pain has 

 4  improved, but at times, with strenuous activity, feels more 

 5  pain in the left scrotum."  

 6          Is that an accurate description of how things were 

 7  going?  

 8      A.  Correct.  

 9      Q.  You had an ultrasound in May 2023, according to 

10  Dr. Bui, that showed, "a normal right testicle and no 

11  abnormal masses or anything else present."  

12          Do you remember him telling you that?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Okay.  Dr. Bui says your right side pain has 

15  improved markedly, and your left is still painful, very 

16  painful most of the time?  

17      A.  Correct.  

18      Q.  He said, "Post-left orchiectomy pain has been better 

19  overall"; is that accurate?  

20      A.  At times, yeah.  

21      Q.  He says, "However, again, at times, with strenuous 

22  activity, the left testicle pain does get worse."

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  Okay.  And there was some discussion about maybe it 

25  being phantom pain, and Dr. Bui recommended you see a pain 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    120

 1  specialist?  

 2      A.  Correct.  

 3      Q.  Do you remember that?  

 4      A.  Yeah.  

 5      Q.  Okay.  All right.  So, then, it looks like you were 

 6  referred to a pain specialist.  I don't know if I'm going to 

 7  be able to pronounce his name correctly, but I would 

 8  pronounce it Brett Quave'?  

 9      A.  I think it's Quave.  

10      Q.  Yeah.  There you go.  

11      A.  Yeah.  

12      Q.  Brett Quave.  It looks, to me, he is over in 

13  Medford; is that right?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  You went to see Dr. Quave at Pain Specialists of 

16  Southern Oregon on August 2nd of 2023.  

17          Does that sound right?  

18      A.  Correct.  

19      Q.  So you drove over the pass and saw him about your 

20  pain?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  It looks like he took a pretty detailed history of 

23  all the things that you had gone through.  

24          Do you remember having those discussions?  

25      A.  Correct.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    121

 1      Q.  Okay.  He was talking about the fact that you were 

 2  continuing to take oxycodone; correct?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  He mentioned -- Dr. Quave -- that you have a history 

 5  of chronic low back pain, and you had a surgery in February 

 6  2009, after a motor vehicle accident, and the surgery had 

 7  occurred in Bend?  

 8      A.  Correct.  

 9      Q.  Okay.  So he mentioned there a "history of chronic 

10  low back pain."  

11          Was that still an issue you were dealing with?  

12      A.  No.  He just asked me if I have pain for it, and I 

13  told him, yeah, at times.  I use my hot tub for therapy.  

14  So -- but if I'm not trying to lift too hard or heavy, then 

15  I don't have -- usually have any pain with my back, so -- 

16      Q.  Got it.  He had, actually, mentioned in the next 

17  sentence that that surgery was successful, but he said 

18  you're now having some current low back pain with radiating 

19  symptoms down your posterior thigh -- so the back thigh -- 

20  and the left-anterior shin with numbness and tingling?  

21      A.  Because of the way I was walking.  

22      Q.  Do you remember having those symptoms?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  But I do remember lots of references to the hot tub.  

25          So you have a hot tub at your house?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    122

 1      A.  Yeah.  

 2      Q.  And it sounds like, or looks like, according to the 

 3  records, that is something that you've used quite a bit to 

 4  get relief?  

 5      A.  Oh, yeah.  

 6      Q.  It find heat helps?  

 7      A.  Yeah.  I've got a hand warmer on my scrotum right 

 8  now.  

 9      Q.  Is that like a hand warmer like a person might put 

10  in a mitten or a glove?  

11      A.  Yeah.  A rechargeable one.  

12      Q.  So the heat helps more than the cold?  

13      A.  Oh, yeah.  

14      Q.  A lot more?  

15      A.  A lot more.  The cold -- I try not to even work in 

16  the cold because it hurts so bad.  I can't swim.  I get in 

17  cold water, and it hurts and throbs bad, super sensitive to 

18  the cold.  

19      Q.  All right.  And you talked about the medications and 

20  other things.  

21          Did Dr. Quave express any opinion to you about what 

22  was causing you to have the pain you were having?  

23      A.  He said something about one of the nerves.  There's 

24  a chance it could be one of the nerves that lead to that 

25  area of the scrotum.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    123

 1      Q.  All right.  His note mentions pain related to a 

 2  genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve?  

 3      A.  Yeah.  

 4      Q.  It sounds like that was something he described to 

 5  you?  

 6      A.  Correct.  

 7      Q.  He talked with you about having a nerve block --  

 8      A.  Correct.  

 9      Q.  -- to see if that would help.  

10          Do you remember that?  

11      A.  Yeah.  

12      Q.  And you indicated you would agree with that to have 

13  the nerve block and then go from there?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  Did he do the nerve block there at that visit, or 

16  did you come back?  

17      A.  They scheduled a surgery or a -- another time I had 

18  to have someone, because I was being put under, they had to 

19  bring -- I had to have someone bring me over.  

20      Q.  Oh, okay.  I see that.  It looks like you came back 

21  on the 17th of August, and you had a left genital branch of 

22  the genitofemoral nerve block under fluoroscopy?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  Did you find that to provide you any relief?  

25      A.  I think it was more of a temporary relief, because 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    124

 1  it didn't -- it didn't take long.  I think I was off work 

 2  for a couple days.  I think he said to take two or three 

 3  days off or something, something real short.  But it ended 

 4  up being just like a -- like a temporary relief.  

 5          I don't know if it was from not working, being 

 6  elevated in bed, and taking medication; but as soon as I was 

 7  back on my feet and working, it would hurt right back to 

 8  square one.  

 9      Q.  So, it looks like you came back to the office and 

10  you saw one of Dr. Quave's partners, a Dr. Meehan?  

11      A.  Yes.  

12      Q.  In early September of 2023?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Do you remember doing that?  

15      A.  Yes.  

16      Q.  And Dr. Meehan said, among other things, that you 

17  two discussed left ilioinguinal nerve block as a potential 

18  option?  

19      A.  Yes.  

20      Q.  But a nerve block just in another location?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  It sounds like you agreed to proceed and have that?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  There was also mention of referral to OHSU or 

25  Stanford University Pain?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    125

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  So you came back to their office, or their surgery 

 3  center -- wherever -- on September 25th; is that right?  And 

 4  it looks like you had a procedure, a fluoroscopy-guided left 

 5  ilioinguinal nerve block?  

 6      A.  Correct.  

 7      Q.  Did you get relief from that nerve block?  

 8      A.  Then, again, it was like the other nerve block.  It 

 9  was very minimal, temporary, same thing; off for a couple 

10  days, take it easy, and then right back on my feet again, 

11  right back to the same pain.  

12      Q.  It looks like, in a follow-up visit with Dr. Meehan 

13  about a month later, the report was that you had about 

14  30 percent pain relief for about a week?  

15      A.  Yeah.  

16      Q.  Does that sound about right?  

17      A.  Yeah.  It was minimal.  

18      Q.  Okay.  Dr. Meehan indicated that he thought this 

19  might be left-sided ilioinguinal neuralgia, specifically 

20  pain-related to a genital branch.  

21          Do you remember having discussions with him at that 

22  visit about those types of things?  

23      A.  He said something along the lines of something like 

24  that, yeah.  

25      Q.  Okay.  So, then, he talked about, it looks like, an 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    126

 1  order for a left ilioinguinal nerve block and ordered a 

 2  referral to OHSU Urology?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  Did he make a referral to Stanford as well, or was 

 5  there just discussion about, potentially, doing that?  

 6      A.  Well, he asked me if I wanted to go, maybe, 

 7  somewhere in California or stay in Oregon to try to get 

 8  help, like either OHSU or maybe San Francisco or something.  

 9  He was -- and I said, "I want to stay in Oregon.  I need to 

10  stay as close as I can to my family and where I live.  I 

11  would prefer to go to OHSU first before trying anything 

12  else.  

13      Q.  Why not refer you back do Dr. Bui?  Why refer you to 

14  OHSU Urology?  Do you know?  

15      A.  He thinks that there's better doctors at OHSU and 

16  that maybe there's something else that they'll find that 

17  Dr. Bui can't, because my last discussion with Dr. Bui was 

18  that he didn't -- he was kind of at a loss; like he didn't 

19  know where else to go, like, kind of I needed more help than 

20  what he could help me with.  

21      Q.  So, the pain management office put in a referral for 

22  you to go up to OHSU?  

23      A.  Yes.  

24      Q.  It looks like, according to the records, at this 

25  point in time, had you stopped communicating with 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    127

 1  Dr. Peters?  

 2      A.  Oh, yeah.  A long time ago.  

 3      Q.  Yeah.  When was your last communication with 

 4  Dr. Peters?  

 5      A.  It was pretty much right around, like -- I don't 

 6  know.  It was maybe a couple hours -- couple months after 

 7  the initial thing, because he was going on maternity leave; 

 8  so he pushed me on Erin Gonzales, and I haven't heard from 

 9  him or talked to him since.  So, it wasn't shortly after 

10  this whole situation had happened that he told me to get a 

11  second opinion, and then he went -- he went on maternity 

12  leave with his wife, and I've been dealing with everything 

13  else.  

14      Q.  Okay.  So you haven't communicated with him since he 

15  went on his leave?  

16      A.  I haven't.  

17      Q.  So, then, it looks like -- are you okay to keep 

18  going, or you need a break?  

19      A.  Can I get a break for a minute.  

20          MR. TUENGE:  We've been going a while let's do that.  

21          VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going off the record.  The time 

22  is 11:55.  

23                (Break.) 

24          VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on the record.  The time 

25  is 12:08.

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    128

 1      Q.  BY MR. TUENGE:  Okay.  We took a break.  Are you 

 2  okay to continue?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  Just, again, tell me if you need a break as we go 

 5  along.  

 6      A.  Good.  

 7      Q.  It looks like, according to the records, you were 

 8  referred up to OHSU Urology, and you saw a doctor up there 

 9  by the name of Dr. Koprowski?  

10      A.  Correct.  

11      Q.  It looks like that happened in February of 2024.  

12          Is that consistent with your memory?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  According to Dr. Koprowski's records, you went over 

15  a history of what had brought you there with Dr. Kaprowski.  

16          Do you remember doing that?  

17      A.  Yes, I do.  

18      Q.  Okay.  I don't see that Dr. Kaprowski performed a 

19  physical examination.  

20          Do you recall one way or the other at that first 

21  visit whether he did?  

22      A.  I believe -- at one point, I remember, he gave me a 

23  lidocaine; so I don't remember if I had went up there twice 

24  or if he gave me the lidocaine at that visit.  

25      Q.  Okay.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    129

 1      A.  Or some kind of numbing -- I don't know if that was 

 2  the exact word for it.  

 3      Q.  According to his record at that first visit, on 

 4  February 6 of 2024, Dr. Kaprowski wrote in his record that 

 5  this was a very interesting case, and he said your "pain 

 6  vanished with an anterior scrotal block centered around the 

 7  prior incisions"?  

 8      A.  So that's -- that would be the medicine he injected 

 9  into my scrotum.  

10      Q.  Tell me about that.  

11      A.  So he -- yeah, he came up with the idea, "Let's try 

12  this and see if it works," and he left the room, came back, 

13  and he injected, into my scrotum, a liquid, and he said, 

14  "I'm going to leave the room.  I'll be back in a little bit, 

15  and we'll see if you get any kind of relief from it."

16      Q.  And it looks like you did.  You used the word 

17  "vanished"?  

18      A.  Yeah.  It was gone.  

19      Q.  Gone?  

20      A.  Gone.  Didn't hurt.  I don't know if it was because, 

21  whatever he did numbed it, and it just took the pain away.  

22  But I know it was pretty emotional for me at that point.  

23      Q.  And Dr. Kaprowski in his records said, "He suspected 

24  that, on the microscopic level, you had some neuropathic 

25  pain, and he noted that, given your response to that scrotum 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    130

 1  block, Dr. Kaprowski then offered a scrotoplasty?  

 2      A.  Correct.  

 3      Q.  And what did you understand a scrotoplasty was?  

 4      A.  Removal of the scrotum.  

 5      Q.  And he had an informed consent discussion with you 

 6  about that?  

 7      A.  Correct.  

 8      Q.  And you decided that you would give that a try?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  Okay.  All right.  And then there's a note, March 26 

11  of 2024.  I don't know if this was an in-person visit or 

12  just in preparation in the hospital.  There's a note about 

13  you being scheduled to undergo a scrotoplasty and partial 

14  scrotectomy?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  That procedure looks like it was performed on 

17  March 26th?  

18      A.  Yes.  

19      Q.  And that was performed -- was that performed at OHSU 

20  Adventist Hospital in Portland?  

21      A.  I believe so.  Downtown.  

22      Q.  Sort of on the east side of Portland off of 205?  

23      A.  This was downtown.  

24      Q.  Okay.  How long were you at the facility for that 

25  procedure?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    131

 1      A.  Most of the day.  I believe it was scheduled for in 

 2  the morning, and I left later that night.  

 3      Q.  Who, if anyone, came up here for that procedure with 

 4  you?  

 5      A.  Mike Hamilton.  

 6      Q.  One of your work colleagues?  

 7      A.  Yeah.  He's our truck boss.  He runs the front 

 8  office.  

 9      Q.  Did you stay in a hotel?  

10      A.  Correct.  

11      Q.  And it looks like -- does it look like, after the 

12  procedure, you developed some challenges -- blood blisters, 

13  swelling -- 

14      A.  The -- 

15      Q.  -- bruising?  

16      A.  The next morning, when I woke up, I couldn't really 

17  identify what was going on.  

18      Q.  Yeah.  

19      A.  And so I called Chris and just asked him if this is 

20  normal, and he said, "It's a pretty severe surgery, and that 

21  it's going to take time to heal."

22      Q.  By "Chris," that's Dr. Kaprowski?  

23      A.  Oh, excuse, me.  Yes, Kaprowski.  

24      Q.  Did Dr. Kaprowski, at that visit or any visit ever, 

25  express any criticism of Dr. Peters or Dr. Smith?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    132

 1      A.  No.  

 2      Q.  It looks like you took some pictures of what was 

 3  going on.  You, actually, sent those to Dr. Kaprowski to 

 4  have him look at those?  

 5      A.  Correct.  I didn't want to leave Portland and come 

 6  all the way to Southern Oregon, if there was something that 

 7  was wrong; so I wanted to -- him to see what I was seeing 

 8  that next morning.  

 9      Q.  Okay.  And you -- did you speak with his staff, 

10  then, about what you were seeing --  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  -- on the phone? 

13          Okay.  They have a note in the record that they -- 

14  the staff returned your call and relayed Dr. Kaprowski's 

15  belief that he wasn't concerned about what was going on and 

16  you understood that.  Their note also says you reported to 

17  them that you spoke with your lawyer, who suggested that you 

18  ask about postoperative antibiotics.  

19          Do you remember asking them, at that point on the 

20  phone, about postoperative antibiotics?  

21      A.  I believe at some point I asked them because of 

22  how -- all the swelling, but I remember that, from what 

23  Dr. Bui had said about taking antibiotics, it could be an 

24  infection, or whatever, previously.  So that's probably why 

25  I said something about taking antibiotics, or maybe even 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    133

 1  Chris gave me antibiotics, if I remember right.  

 2      Q.  Do you remember there, then, being a discussion 

 3  about you suing OHSU and telling them you weren't suing OHSU 

 4  and suing somebody else.  

 5          Do you remember having a discussion about that?  

 6      A.  No.  

 7      Q.  Their record says, "Mr. Ricketts says he's happy 

 8  with OHSU's care, no legal action against us, but against 

 9  his previous surgical team."  

10          Do you remember having any conversation like that?  

11      A.  No.  

12      Q.  How long did you stay in Portland, following that 

13  procedure, before heading back home?  

14      A.  I left about checkout time, the next day, of the 

15  hotel.  I just wanted to make sure that he didn't need to 

16  see me in person before I left.  

17      Q.  And it looks like, when you got back home, there was 

18  a phone note on April 4th; you were still having some blood 

19  from your scrotum?  

20      A.  Correct.  

21      Q.  And you had a discussion with the folks at OHSU 

22  about that?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  You updated them with some photos about what was 

25  going on?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    134

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  Did you get any relief, at all, from that procedure 

 3  that Dr. Kaprowski performed?  

 4      A.  Now or at that time?  

 5      Q.  Let's break that down.  How about at that time.  

 6          After it occurred, did you get any relief?  

 7      A.  Right away, no.  

 8      Q.  Right away, no?  

 9      A.  No.  

10      Q.  So same pain.  How about now?  

11      A.  Yeah.  

12      Q.  Yes?  

13      A.  Yes.  

14      Q.  Tell me about that.  

15      A.  I believe that the topical pain that I was feeling 

16  is gone, and I feel that the pain that's left inside is the 

17  throbbing and the pounding that -- the more interior pain is 

18  what I'm left with, but I feel like, after that procedure, 

19  it had helped a little bit.  

20      Q.  Can you quantify that in way:  "It helped a little 

21  bit"?  Like, for example, take your pain from --  

22      A.  To the touch.  

23      Q.  Okay.  Did it make the pain to the touch go away?  

24      A.  Yeah.  

25      Q.  So that pain is gone.  So now, if you're -- if that 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    135

 1  area rubs against a pant leg or a car seat or anything like 

 2  that, that's no longer painful -- the rubbing?  

 3      A.  I believe it's because it's gone.  

 4      Q.  Okay.  So that's disappeared?  

 5      A.  Yeah.  

 6      Q.  What you're left with is that painful feeling inside 

 7  what remains of your scrotum?  

 8      A.  Correct.  

 9      Q.  Do you have half a scrotum?  

10      A.  Maybe a quarter of a scrotum.  

11      Q.  Quarter of a scrotum.  

12          That would be the quarter of the scrotum on the 

13  right side?  

14      A.  Yeah.  I believe that they -- they cut my scrotum 

15  right up the middle or more and pulled it over and sewed it 

16  against my left leg.  So it just holds my testicles so tight 

17  it don't look like it used to.  It don't, like, have any 

18  elastic; you know, you can't pull on it or anything.  It's 

19  just tight.  

20      Q.  So you have a right testicle?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  And you have a right portion of your scrotum?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  That holds your testicle?  

25      A.  Correct.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    136

 1      Q.  And that is stitched up to your body?  

 2      A.  Correct.  It was split right down the middle and 

 3  then sewed over to my left leg because they took a diameter 

 4  of a chunk out, so -- 

 5      Q.  If you were to take a finger or a Q-tip -- whatever 

 6  instrument you want -- and you were to touch what remains of 

 7  your scrotum all the way on the outside, would touching it 

 8  like that be painful?  

 9      A.  I think on that far-back left side where the initial 

10  was, if you push in on it, yes, it's painful; but to touch 

11  it, no.  

12      Q.  Isn't that far-back left side gone?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Okay.  So today, with what remains of your scrotum 

15  and your testicle, if you were to touch all around your 

16  scrotum, would just the act of touching the scrotum be 

17  painful?  

18      A.  No.  

19      Q.  That pain is gone?  

20      A.  Yes.  

21      Q.  You can touch all the way around at 360 degrees, and 

22  the touching of it is not painful?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  What is painful is inside the scrotum?  

25      A.  Yeah.  Like pushing in on it.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    137

 1      Q.  Pushing in?  

 2      A.  Pushing in on it where my testicle used to be --  

 3      Q.  Yeah.  

 4      A.  -- on that far back left side, when you push in on 

 5  it, it feels -- I feel it instantly, throbbing and pounding.  

 6  That's where I feel all the pain.  It's no longer on the top 

 7  of the skin, you know.  

 8      Q.  Do you feel pain in the right testicle?  

 9      A.  No.  Only discomfort from positioning, I believe.  

10      Q.  Does the pain, that you have, radiate outside of 

11  your scrotum in any location?  

12      A.  Sometimes I feel it in my left side; sometimes, kind 

13  of, just I get discomfort more, but not necessarily the pain 

14  itself.  

15      Q.  When you described the left side, it looked like 

16  you, actually, kind of, touched an area over, sort of, just 

17  above your left hip, sort of, by the stomach?  

18      A.  Yeah.  It's like as if you got hit in the scrotum 

19  really hard and you get the gut pain that hurts, that's what 

20  it feels like on the left side.  

21      Q.  Gut pain on the left side?  

22      A.  Yeah.  

23      Q.  That happens when there's pushing on the testicle?  

24      A.  Correct.  Or any kind of, like, flexing of my 

25  stomach.  My heart rate, when I start breathing heavy, I 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    138

 1  feel it.  It feels like a heartbeat in there, just throbbing 

 2  and pounding.  

 3      Q.  Are there ever points in time during the day that 

 4  you have zero-out-of-ten pain in your scrotum area?  

 5      A.  I would say the best that I feel every day is in my 

 6  hot tub in the morning when I drink my coffee, and I relax 

 7  in my hot tub for at least a half hour.  

 8      Q.  And does that give you a zero-out-of-ten period of 

 9  time?  

10      A.  I would say before I get out, yeah, I don't have any 

11  pain.  

12      Q.  Okay.  Is that something you do every morning, 

13  coffee in the hot tub?  

14      A.  Every morning.  

15      Q.  Okay.  For a half an hour?  

16      A.  Yeah.  Sometimes longer, depends on work schedules 

17  and everything.  Yeah, if I could stay in there all day, I 

18  would for sure.  

19      Q.  Tell me, on an average day, what is your pain level?  

20      A.  A lot of it has to do with -- on an average day of 

21  working or on an average day of, like, on the weekend with 

22  my kids?  

23      Q.  I'm glad you asked for that clarification.  So with 

24  that, let's do -- break that down.  It sounds like maybe 

25  it's different.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    139

 1      A.  Oh, yeah.  

 2      Q.  Okay.  So, on a day where you're working, tell me 

 3  about how the pain is on a workday.  

 4      A.  Well, it all starts with once I lace up my boots.  I 

 5  bend over and put on my boots and get going, I could feel 

 6  it.  When I sit in my truck and start my truck and start 

 7  heading to work, I can feel it just, like, starting to throb 

 8  and unloading tools out of the back of my truck.  And it 

 9  depends on what I'm doing.  

10          If I'm operating all day long, getting beat up in an 

11  excavator, ripping out sidewalks and concrete and getting 

12  thrown back and forth, left and right.  I load a truck.  I 

13  hop out.  I try to walk a little bit, walk to my truck.  I 

14  don't keep water in the excavator; that way I have a reason 

15  to get out, get something to drink, move around, maybe even 

16  circulation.  I'm not sure.  I know, leaning forward, 

17  filling out time cards and stuff like this really hurts.  I 

18  don't know if it's cutting off circulation.  

19          I know that lifting, you know, especially heavy 

20  stuff, which I don't do anymore, but it could be moving a 

21  bag of concrete, you know, or something like that.  

22  60 pounds, I can't -- not without throbbing and pounding and 

23  hurting.  

24      Q.  You have that throbbing, pounding, and hurting -- is 

25  that all in the testicle area, the scrotum?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    140

 1      A.  Yeah.  

 2      Q.  So an average workday, what is your pain level while 

 3  you're working?  

 4      A.  It goes anywhere from three to six, three to seven; 

 5  and then by the time I get home -- you know, because I 

 6  usually start taking my ibuprofen, or something, in the 

 7  morning to, kind of, help me get going and stuff.  And by 

 8  the time I go to get off work -- I can't take my pain 

 9  medication until I get off work, because I'm an operator.  

10          When I get off work, I take my pain medication.  I 

11  jump in the shower, and then I try to help my wife out 

12  around the house, deal with the kids, you know, help with 

13  cooking and stuff like that.  By the time I sit down and 

14  relax, that's all I feel is the throbbing and the pounding 

15  in there, but I feel like the pain medication, kind of, 

16  helps mask it and numb it.  So, it's kind of a good thing.  

17          I feel it all day long; so I don't overdo it because 

18  I'm afraid that, if I take too much medication, I won't feel 

19  it, and I'll hurt it, so -- 

20      Q.  Are you able to sleep during the night?  

21      A.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if it's -- a lot of it has 

22  to do with -- I was taking melatonin in the beginning for a 

23  while.  I don't take it anymore, but I was taking melatonin 

24  to help me sleep, because I'm a mind racer; my mind don't 

25  stop.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    141

 1      Q.  Let's talk about a weekend, then, when you're not 

 2  working.  Tell me about how your pain is.  

 3      A.  It's a little more mild, a little less expectations.  

 4  You know what I mean?  But at the same time, I still have 

 5  yard work.  I've still got two kids that are very young that 

 6  want to play, and it's a little easier to lay down on the 

 7  ground and elevate my feet and play with them, whether they 

 8  are doing puzzles or playing chess.  

 9          A lot of the time, when I play with my kids, I'm on 

10  the ground.  Sitting at, like, a table and stuff like that 

11  really hurts.  It's not very comfortable sitting up, sitting 

12  forward.  I feel a lot less pain laying down; so a lot of 

13  the times, I'll lay down either on my side or my back, and I 

14  don't know if it's a circulation thing or something.  

15      Q.  And when you described leaning forward, just for the 

16  written record, you were describing sitting in a seat like 

17  you are now with a desk in front of you.  If you sit in your 

18  seat and you lean forward on the desk, like you're going to 

19  sign a document or do a puzzle, that's a painful position?  

20      A.  Correct.  Yes, it is.  

21      Q.  Laying down is not a painful position?  

22      A.  No.  

23      Q.  Having your feet elevated, laying down, putting your 

24  feet up is not painful?  

25      A.  No.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    142

 1      Q.  Okay.  Tell me about your medication regimen.  

 2          What medications are you currently taking on a daily 

 3  and weekly basis?  

 4      A.  I alternate from ibuprofen and Tylenol, and then I 

 5  also take oxycodone.  

 6      Q.  So on an average workday, let's break that down.  

 7  How much ibuprofen do you take on a workday?  

 8      A.  I try not to take as much, because Dr. Erin Gonzales 

 9  told me not to take so much.  At first, I was told you could 

10  take 30 pills a day.  So try to only take -- I usually -- 

11  like today, I've had six, but usually, I don't eat more than 

12  12 ibuprofen in a day.  

13      Q.  Are those the over-the-counter that you get at the 

14  grocery store or pharmacy?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  Are they the Extra Strength Tylenol or Advil or 

17  ibuprofen?  Do you know?  

18      A.  I think they are just the 200 milligram ibuprofen.  

19      Q.  Right.  So 12 is your maximum; you're usually 

20  somewhere between 6 and 12?  

21      A.  Yeah.  Because, usually, if I take one of the 

22  oxycodone, it helps a lot with the pain.  So, when I'm able 

23  to take that, I don't have to take the -- so many ibuprofen 

24  and things like that.  Just, I don't have to.  

25      Q.  Do you take Tylenol when you take ibuprofen, or is 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    143

 1  that something you take when you're alternating?  

 2      A.  I was told to alternate it, so -- 

 3      Q.  That's what you do?  

 4      A.  Yeah.  

 5      Q.  Similarly, you take an over-the-counter Tylenol?  

 6      A.  Correct.  500 milligram Tylenols.  

 7      Q.  How many of those do you take on a workday?  

 8      A.  I'll usually take two at a time, and then sometimes 

 9  I'll take -- usually, if I do ibuprofen in the morning, I'll 

10  do more Tylenol in the afternoon, and then maybe take an 

11  ibuprofen before I get off, a dose of them.  

12      Q.  And on a workday, did I understand correctly that 

13  you take oxycodone once you get home at night?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  Do you take one?  

16      A.  I'll take two.  

17      Q.  Two oxycodone, and that's it for the evening?  

18      A.  No.  Usually depends on how bad I'm in a shape 

19  because usually, by the end of the day, I'm usually banged 

20  up, hurting.  Some days it's not so bad, so I'll only take 

21  one.  But it seems like, since I've been taking them for 

22  over three years now, I've built a tolerance; so I can take 

23  two of the 5 milligrams when I get home, and I always take 

24  one right before bed, so -- 

25      Q.  Is your medication regimen pretty similar on the 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    144

 1  weekend, or do you tone it down?  

 2      A.  No.  Because I could usually take one by about 

 3  ten o'clock, and it will help me throughout the whole day 

 4  without having to take so many ibuprofen and Tylenol.  And 

 5  then I'm able to take one before dinner, and I'll take the 

 6  other one before bed.  So it's definitely a lot less Tylenol 

 7  and ibuprofen during the weekend.  

 8      Q.  Are you taking any other medications or 

 9  over-the-counter items for your scrotum and testicular 

10  issues, other than Tylenol, ibuprofen, and oxycodone?  

11      A.  No.  That's it.  

12      Q.  I won't spend a lot of time on it, but there's some 

13  records that, when you were back here in Klamath Falls, you 

14  had a -- you had a wound issue, and you came to the 

15  emergency department and had to follow up with OHSU.  

16          Can you, sort of, tell me what happened there.  

17      A.  Yeah.  I believe it was April 8th I was in the 

18  emergency room after that -- that scrotoplasty.  I guess I 

19  never stopped bleeding; so I filled up with blood clots, and 

20  the blood clots were falling out of me in the shower.  So I 

21  was trying to smash them down the drain while I was trying 

22  to get my wife to call Mike Hamilton, and he left work.  

23          And I was holding my scrotum shut with my hand in my 

24  shower, and I remember asking Mike -- or asking my wife to 

25  get Mike because I didn't want my wife to be involved 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    145

 1  because she doesn't do well with stuff like that.  And he 

 2  took me -- he took me to the emergency room, and all of the 

 3  stitches had blown open, like four inches of the incision, 

 4  and blood clots were falling out of me so -- 

 5      Q.  Did you ever get an explanation for why all the 

 6  incisions came open?  

 7      A.  It's because I filled up with blood, and the 

 8  stitches dissolved.  

 9      Q.  And then I know there's a lot to that, but you 

10  followed up at OHSU, and you got that resolved after some 

11  time?  

12      A.  Yeah.  I was in the emergency room up there for a 

13  little while, and they got me cleaned up and got everything 

14  put back together and got me sewed up.  

15      Q.  All right.  It looks like you had a visit in August 

16  with a doctor where you were found to have a basal cell 

17  carcinoma, a skin issue on your shoulder?  

18      A.  Correct.  They cut it out of my shoulder.  It was 

19  melanoma.  

20      Q.  A skin cancer?  

21      A.  Yeah.  I just had one burned off on, I think, 

22  Thursday off my face.  I went for my one year, and then 

23  they -- I told them I had a little dry spot here, and he 

24  looked at it, and he burned it off.  You probably see it.  I 

25  had some medicine on it this morning.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    146

 1      Q.  On that left cheek?  

 2      A.  Yeah.  

 3      Q.  Have you had any other treatment for carcinoma, 

 4  other than having the spot removed on your left shoulder --  

 5      A.  No.  

 6      Q.  -- and on your left cheek?  

 7      A.  Correct.  

 8      Q.  You go in for yearly checks for that?  

 9      A.  Yes.  

10      Q.  Okay.  All right.  Dr. Gonzales is your PCP.  You're 

11  following up with her, as needed.  

12          Are you seeing Dr. Kaprowski at OHSU on a regular 

13  basis, or has that care, essentially, come to an end?  

14      A.  He was done with me after that, and I was referred 

15  to the neurosurgeon at OHSU.  

16      Q.  All right.  I wanted to finish there.  That's where 

17  my records end.  It looks like you followed up with the OHSU 

18  neurosurgical team in late fall 2024, and then again this 

19  year, 2025; is that right?  

20      A.  Correct.  

21      Q.  And was the purpose of following up with them and 

22  having a visit with them to talk about having a spinal cord 

23  stimulater?  

24      A.  Yes.  

25      Q.  And your understanding of a spinal cord stimulater, 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    147

 1  that's something that they put in your spine to help relieve 

 2  chronic pain?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  Okay.  In order to have a spinal stimulator, usually 

 5  they do a trial, and they place probes and see if it works.  

 6          Have you undergone a trial for that?  

 7      A.  We were scheduled, but my insurance denied me.  So 

 8  we're in the second or third stage of appeals, and I did the 

 9  psych eval and everything.  And we're in the appeals of 

10  trying to get it.  I've been trying since October to get it 

11  to hopefully take this pain away.  

12      Q.  What is your insurance?  

13      A.  PacificSource Cascades East -- or Cascade something, 

14  I think.  PacificSource.  

15      Q.  Is that insurance through your employer?  

16      A.  Correct.  

17      Q.  Has that been the same insurance, say, for the last 

18  five years, that you've had?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  So, you're in the process of appealing that, so that 

21  you can have a trial of the stimulater?  

22      A.  Yeah.  Because we don't even know if it's going to 

23  work.  

24      Q.  Have the folks at OHSU, the neurosurgical team, 

25  recommended that you have the trial to see if it works?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    148

 1      A.  Yeah.  We've been trying.  I've been working with 

 2  them, trying to get it, to get the insurance to help me pay 

 3  for it because it's like $65,000.  So it's a lot of money.  

 4      Q.  Is that something that you are interested in 

 5  pursuing?  

 6      A.  I want to get it done back -- I wanted to get it 

 7  done in October because, if I could have got it done and 

 8  been pain free, I wouldn't have gone the last six, seven 

 9  months in pain, so -- 

10      Q.  All right.  And the last record that I have, I 

11  think, is -- oh, it's a video visit, April 30th.  I think 

12  that was your psych eval; is that right?  

13      A.  Yeah.  

14      Q.  Have you had follow-up with OHSU since the psyche 

15  eval?  

16      A.  No.  I keep calling them, going over the phone, and 

17  they said it could take some time, but we've got to get -- 

18  work with insurance in order to get the trial paid for.  

19      Q.  So as we sit here today, what is your understanding 

20  about what happens next?  Are you waiting to hear back from 

21  insurance?  

22      A.  I'm waiting to hear back from OHSU scheduling to see 

23  if I was approved, if my insurance would pay for it.  

24      Q.  Do you have any sense of the timing of when they'll 

25  tell you that?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    149

 1      A.  She said it should -- just be patient.  It could be, 

 2  you know, three to four weeks, but if I don't hear back from 

 3  them in the three to four works, go ahead and call them 

 4  again.  

 5      Q.  Is that three to four weeks from now?  

 6      A.  From the time I had a phone call, and I believe I 

 7  called her last week.  So, she said it just takes time.  

 8      Q.  Do you have any appointments scheduled with any 

 9  medical providers, as we sit here today, related to your 

10  scrotum and groin?  

11      A.  Just waiting on that DRG nerve stimulater.  

12      Q.  Okay.  So, at least as far as you're concerned now, 

13  you're no longer seeing a urologist; correct?  

14      A.  No.  

15      Q.  Are you -- 

16      A.  Sorry.  

17      Q.  Are you seeing a pain management doctor, or has that 

18  stopped?  

19      A.  I -- I believe they sent me to the neurosurgeon for 

20  pain management to see if the nerve stimulator would be 

21  beneficial for me or not.  

22      Q.  Is the only prescription medication, that you're 

23  taking related to your groin, oxycodone?  

24      A.  Correct.  

25      Q.  Is it Dr. Gonzales who prescribes that?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    150

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  You stopped going over the hill to see the pain 

 3  management specialist over in Medford?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  You said you're also taking testosterone injections?  

 6      A.  Yes, I am.  

 7      Q.  Is that -- are those injections that you do 

 8  yourself?  

 9      A.  My wife does them for me.  

10      Q.  Your wife does those for you?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  Other than the testosterone and the pain medicine 

13  we're talking about, are you taking any other medications 

14  for any other issues?  

15      A.  No, I'm not.  

16      Q.  Are you taking any antidepressant medications?  

17      A.  No, I'm not.  

18      Q.  Any anti-anxiety medications?  

19      A.  No.  

20      Q.  Just Tylenol, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and getting 

21  testosterone injections?  

22      A.  Correct.  I do have a nasal spray on file that I use 

23  for my sinus stuff, but -- 

24      Q.  That's a prescription nasal spray?  

25      A.  Yeah, from Erin Gonzales.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    151

 1      Q.  So, that's different than the nasal spray, that you 

 2  showed me, in your pocket?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  Okay.  All right.  So, I'm going to shift gears now, 

 5  away from your medical care, and talk about your employment, 

 6  and then we'll be done.  

 7      A.  Okay.  

 8      Q.  Before I do that -- I asked you about Dr. Mirande; I 

 9  asked you about Dr. Bui; and I asked you about 

10  Dr. Kaprowski.  

11          Let me ask a global question:  Other than what 

12  you've already told me from those doctors, has any other 

13  doctor expressed any criticism to you about Dr. Peters' or 

14  Dr. Smith's care?  

15      A.  No.  

16      Q.  Okay.  All right.  So let's talk about your 

17  employment, and why don't we go back to -- let's go about 

18  five years back, before you had your vasectomy, and pick up 

19  from there.  So that would be -- what? -- 2018, 2017?  

20      A.  Correct.  

21      Q.  Tell me about your employment from 2017 up until the 

22  time you decided to go see Dr. Peters to talk about a 

23  vasectomy?  

24      A.  It was a blast.  

25      Q.  Where were you working and for whom?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    152

 1      A.  Rocky Mountain Construction.  

 2      Q.  You were?  

 3      A.  Yeah.  

 4      Q.  Okay .  When did you start working for Rocky 

 5  Mountain Construction?  

 6      A.  May, two thousand -- I want to say -- '16.  

 7      Q.  Rocky Mountain Construction is a construction 

 8  company?  

 9      A.  Correct.  

10      Q.  Are they local, here, to Klamath?  

11      A.  Yeah.  

12      Q.  Do you know, currently, in 2025, how many employees 

13  Rocky Mountain Construction has?  

14      A.  I believe we're over 150.  

15      Q.  And are those 150 people here in Klamath?  

16      A.  Correct.  

17      Q.  Do you know how many employees Rocky Mountain 

18  Construction had back in 2016 when you started working for 

19  them?  

20      A.  I think we were just over 100.  

21      Q.  So it's grown about 50 employees over that time?  

22      A.  I believe so.  

23      Q.  Who is the owner of Rocky Mountain Construction?  

24      A.  Jamie Jackson.  

25      Q.  Has Mr. Jackson -- is it a Mr. ?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    153

 1      A.  Yes.  

 2      Q.  Has Mr. Jackson been the owner from 2016 up until 

 3  the present?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  So, you've always worked for the company under his 

 6  ownership?  

 7      A.  Correct.  

 8      Q.  When you were hired in May 2016, did you have a job 

 9  title?  

10      A.  Yes.  

11      Q.  What was it?  

12      A.  Laborer.  

13      Q.  In the year 2016, did you work full-time for Rocky 

14  Mountain Construction?  

15      A.  Correct.  

16      Q.  Can you estimate, for me, what your total salary and 

17  earnings were in 2016?  

18      A.  Oh, I would say at least 80,000.  

19      Q.  Okay.  How about in 2017?  Did you continue to be a 

20  laborer?  

21      A.  I believe it was a combination of both, as I picked 

22  up skills on machines and jobs needing laborers compared to 

23  operators; so it was a combination of both.  

24      Q.  Okay.  So, you were a laborer, and you also started 

25  transition into being an operator?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    154

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  Can you -- and I realize these are rough estimates, 

 3  and that's all I'm looking for.  

 4      A.  Sure.  

 5      Q.  Can you give me a rough estimate, in 2017, what your 

 6  overall salary and income was then?  

 7      A.  I would -- I've done pretty well.  I do a lot of 

 8  prevailing-wage projects; so -- which is government and 

 9  State funded projects through cities and states.  So I've 

10  been pretty steady at making over 80,000 a year.  

11      Q.  Okay.  All right.  And then 2018, did you continue 

12  to be both a laborer and an operator?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  I didn't ask, but I presume 2017 was full-time 

15  employment with Rocky Mountain Construction?  

16      A.  Correct.  

17      Q.  Same with 2018?  

18      A.  Correct.  

19      Q.  Was there a seasonal aspect to the employment?  Were 

20  there times in winter where you're not working at all for 

21  Rocky Mountain Construction?  

22      A.  Yeah.  There's times when we slow down and just kind 

23  of slow down.  We build highways and asphalt and things like 

24  that; so there are times when we slow down, and we usually 

25  pick back up in March or April.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    155

 1      Q.  So, from 2016 up until the present, have you had 

 2  employment with any other companies, other than Rocky 

 3  Mountain Construction?  

 4      A.  No.  

 5      Q.  Okay.  So during those down times when you're not 

 6  working for Rocky Mountain Construction, you don't go get 

 7  another job or do something else?  

 8      A.  No.  

 9      Q.  So 2018, picking up again, were you a laborer and 

10  operator?  

11      A.  Yeah.  

12      Q.  2019, same?  

13      A.  Correct, yeah.  

14      Q.  2020, same?  

15      A.  Yeah, correct.  

16      Q.  Was there a point in time when you were no longer a 

17  laborer, and you were just an operator, or have you always 

18  been a laborer/operator since 2017?  

19      A.  The day this happened was the day that my boss kept 

20  me on a machine and told me, "I don't want you --" tried to 

21  make it easy on my body.  

22      Q.  Got you.  

23      A.  It seems like he made accommodations of helping me 

24  out and putting me in a machine.  I'd make more money and  

25  hopefully not have to do the physical stuff that he could 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    156

 1  clearly see I couldn't do, so -- 

 2      Q.  So, from the vasectomy forward, if I understand what 

 3  you're telling me correctly, you then no longer were a 

 4  laborer/operator you became exclusively an operator?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  And that becoming an exclusively, that, actually, 

 7  came with making more money?  

 8      A.  It limited my jobs, so not necessarily making more 

 9  money, but it -- because I -- we don't always need a lot of 

10  operators, but we always need laborers.  So, there's a lost 

11  prevailing-wage projects that need laborers, but as an 

12  operator, now I'm stuck doing driveways.  You know what I 

13  mean?  

14          So, now I'm doing someone's driveway for 30 bucks an 

15  hour, when I could be in California making 96 bucks an hour.  

16  You know what I'm saying?  Either way, I'm running a machine 

17  whether I'm in the driveway at 30 bucks an hour is what I 

18  make now, compared to a prevailing wage when you're making 

19  50, 60, 70, $80 an hour.  

20          But we have so many operators that I don't have the 

21  seniority to always being on the good jobs running the 

22  machines.  So, sometimes laborers are making more than the 

23  operators.  

24      Q.  Got it.  Okay.  

25      A.  So it kind of depends on what job you're on.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    157

 1      Q.  All right.  So I'm going to mark as another 

 2  exhibit -- we'll mark this as Exhibit 2, and maybe this will 

 3  help us through these next couple of years anyway.

 4          (Deposition Exhibit 2 was marked and is 

 5          attached hereto.)

 6          MR. LINTHORST:  Can we take a quick break, Peter?  I 

 7  want to give you something.  

 8          MR. TUENGE:  Yeah.  

 9          VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going off the record.  The time 

10  is 12:43.  

11                (Break.)

12          VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on the record.  The time 

13  is 12:44.  

14      Q.  BY MR. TUENGE:  All right.  We just took a very 

15  brief break.  We're back on the record.  I've handed you 

16  what I've marked as Exhibit 2, and in Exhibit 2, I'll 

17  represent to you, is a set of copies of your 2020, 2021, 

18  2022, and 2023 W-2s, and I think I've got them there in 

19  chronological order.  

20          Do you see those?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  Okay.  And I thought maybe this would help us to, 

23  kind of, go through these to look at your income during 

24  those years.  I only see W-2s, and let me make sure I'm 

25  right.  That's one of the reasons I'm handing this to you.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    158

 1  Feel free to correct me at any time.  I only see W-2s 

 2  through these years from Rocky Mountain Construction?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  Does that make sense?  You wouldn't have W2s from 

 5  anywhere else; right?  

 6      A.  No.  No W-2s from anywhere else.  

 7      Q.  Let's take a look at your 2022 W-2; it's Rocky 

 8  Mountain Construction, Page 1, and if we look at -- let's 

 9  see -- wages, tips, and other compensation there at the top, 

10  it's 86,377.  

11          Do you see that?  

12      A.  Sure.  Yes, I do.  

13      Q.  And I take it that's what you earned in 2020?  

14      A.  Yes.  

15      Q.  Does that sound about right?  

16      A.  Yeah.  I usually make over 80,000; so I don't know 

17  the exact numbers.  My wife is the one that does all the 

18  paperwork.  

19      Q.  Okay.  

20      A.  Sometimes I don't even know when I get a raise.  

21      Q.  I can understand that.  

22          All right.  So 86,377 in 2020.  If we look at 2021, 

23  which is the next page, it looks to me -- and, again, 

24  please -- that's why I'm giving it to you -- correct me if 

25  I'm reading anything incorrect -- 2021, I see wages, tips, 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    159

 1  and other compensation of $96,330.  

 2          Do you see that?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  Let me tell you where I'm looking.  If you look on 

 5  the left, it's the first -- yeah, you got it.  

 6      A.  Okay.  

 7      Q.  Do you see where I'm reading that?  

 8      A.  Yeah.  

 9      Q.  Okay.  And, again, does that sound consistent with 

10  what you were making in 2021?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  So you made about $10,000, give or take, more in 

13  2021?  You're making 96,000-and-some?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  Okay.  And then let's turn to the next page, Page 3; 

16  that's your W-2 from 2022.  

17          Do you see that?  

18      A.  Yes.  

19      Q.  And I'm going to try to look at the same category so 

20  that we're consistent.  Wages, tips, and other compensation 

21  listed in the upper left, it has $85,641.  

22          Do you see that?  

23      A.  Correct.  

24      Q.  Does that sound consistent with your W-2 earnings in 

25  2022?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    160

 1      A.  Yes.  

 2      Q.  Okay.  So that's about 10, maybe 11,000 less than 

 3  2021 and about 1,000 less than 2020?  

 4      A.  Correct.  

 5      Q.  Does that sound right?  

 6      A.  Correct.  

 7      Q.  So, then, the last page of that document is 2023, 

 8  and  if we look at tips -- wages, tips, and other 

 9  compensation, same category, what's listed there is 

10  $77,435.14; is that right?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  All right.  And is that consistent with your memory 

13  of 2023?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15          (Deposition Exhibit 3 was marked and is 

16          attached hereto.)

17      Q.  BY MR. TUENGE:  And then your lawyer just handed me 

18  your W-2 from 2024, which I'll mark as an exhibit, and then 

19  there's a reference I have a question about on Page 1, but 

20  let's start with Page 2 of Exhibit 3, which is your 2024 

21  W-2.  I only have one copy; so I'm going to read it and then 

22  hand it to you.  

23          It has listed here for 2024 your wages, tips, and 

24  other compensation as $98,256, and you can just verify that 

25  I looked at that correctly?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    161

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  Does that sound about right?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  From a W-2 perspective, 2024, you went up pretty 

 5  substantially from 2023?  

 6      A.  Correct.  

 7      Q.  Okay.  I'm going to ask you about that in a minute.  

 8  All right.  And the question I had is, on Page 1 of 

 9  Exhibit 3, which I'll give you, it says, "Name, Address, 

10  Federal ID," and it has listed, "Trails & Trophies 

11  Outfitters, LLC"?  

12      A.  Correct.  

13      Q.  What is that?  

14      A.  A hunting outfit.  

15      Q.  Is it yours?  

16      A.  No.  It's Jamie Jackson's, the boss of Rocky 

17  Mountain.  

18      Q.  What's the reference on that document to the hunting 

19  outfit?  

20      A.  For taking clients on a hunt or working on the ranch 

21  or anything to do with Trails & Trophies, filling deer 

22  feeders for him or anything like that.  

23      Q.  Can I see that.  So did you get a separate W-2 for 

24  the work you did for Trails & Trophies?  

25      A.  It's a 1099.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    162

 1      Q.  It's a 1099.  Okay.  

 2      A.  I don't think it's a W2, because I have to pay my 

 3  own taxes on it.  

 4      Q.  I got it.  

 5      A.  Yeah.  

 6      Q.  But you're paid separately?  

 7      A.  Correct.  

 8      Q.  So the W-2 that we have from Rocky Mountain 

 9  Construction, those are your earnings from Rocky Mountain 

10  Construction?  

11      A.  Sure, yes.  

12      Q.  And you have different earnings from Trails & 

13  Trophies?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  This document, if I'm looking at it correctly, does 

16  this tell us you earned $4,000 from Trails & Trophies?  

17      A.  Correct.  

18      Q.  That's what I'm looking at?  

19      A.  Yep.  

20      Q.  I don't have any document like that, at least not 

21  here.  I'm not saying it wasn't provided.  

22          Do you know, did you earn money from Trails & 

23  Trophies in 2023?  

24      A.  Correct.  

25      Q.  How about 2022?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    163

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  2021?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  How long have you been working with Trails & 

 5  Trophies as well?  

 6      A.  With the ranches and everything my boss owns, I've 

 7  been working since 2016 or '17.  I think '17 is when I got 

 8  involved with Trails & Trophies.  

 9      Q.  Is that, kind of, a side job that you do for extra 

10  stuff?  

11      A.  It's a hunting outfit that my boss has out of Wenaha 

12  up in Eastern Oregon.  

13      Q.  So the document I have in front of me, Page 1 of 

14  Exhibit 3, is for 2024, and it says your income from 

15  Trails & Trophies was $4,000 a year --  

16      A.  Correct.  

17      Q.  -- that year?  Sorry.  

18          If we use that as a guidepost, was your income for 

19  Trails & Trophies similar in 2023?  

20      A.  Correct.  

21      Q.  And how about 2022?  

22      A.  Correct.  

23      Q.  2021?  

24      A.  Correct.  

25      Q.  It will always be about $4,000?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    164

 1      A.  Yes.  

 2      Q.  All right.  So other than Trails & Trophies and 

 3  Rocky Mountain Construction, were you earning any other 

 4  income from any other source between 2020 and now?  

 5      A.  No, I was not.  

 6      Q.  Do you have your own guide in your outdoor business 

 7  that you earn money through?  

 8      A.  I don't.  

 9      Q.  I saw a reference in a record that goes back a 

10  while, I think maybe 2021, to do doing some hunting guiding.  

11  I can look it up to make sure I'm accurate.  

12          Would that have been the Trails & Trophies?  

13      A.  Correct.  

14      Q.  Here is what it is, so we're -- you know what I'm 

15  referring to?  

16      A.  Sure.  

17      Q.  It's a record from Dr. Souza, the ENT, November 

18  2020, and he says, among other things, you grew up in 

19  Klamath; you worked for Rocky Mountain Construction; you 

20  worked as a hunting guide in Mexico in the off season, 

21  Desert Rams Mule Deer coues deer?  

22      A.  Correct.  

23      Q.  That reference is to Trails & Trophies?  

24      A.  Correct.  We either hunt in Eastern Oregon or 

25  sometimes in Mexico.  The Mexico thing came later on.  Now 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    165

 1  it's gotten bigger and bigger, so --  

 2      Q.  What time of year do you do the Mexico hunting 

 3  trips?  

 4      A.  Usually about the first of January.  

 5      Q.  And those are guided trips, I take it, where 

 6  somebody hires your outfit, and you go with the hunter to 

 7  Mexico; you do the hunt and come back with them?  

 8      A.  Correct.  

 9      Q.  Did you do a Mexico trip this January?  

10      A.  Correct.  

11      Q.  For what?  

12      A.  Mule deer.  

13      Q.  In Mexico?  

14      A.  Correct.  

15      Q.  How long were you in Mexico for a hunting trip this 

16  year?  

17      A.  He asked me to stay longer.  I believe I was there 

18  four weeks.  

19      Q.  That's really neat.  Where in Mexico?  

20      A.  North of Hermosillo, a little town called Carbo.  

21      Q.  And you use that as a home base?  

22      A.  Correct.  My boss has a ranch there with a breeding 

23  program and a high-fence hunting for mule deer.  

24      Q.  Any other hunting like that outside the State of 

25  Oregon?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    166

 1      A.  No.  

 2      Q.  So the guided trips are either in Oregon, or they go 

 3  down to the Mexico ranch?  

 4      A.  Yes.  

 5      Q.  Did you do a Mexico trip in 2024?  

 6      A.  Yes.  

 7      Q.  How about 2023?  

 8      A.  Yes.  

 9      Q.  How about 2022?  

10      A.  Yes.  

11      Q.  Have you done it every year for a number of years?  

12      A.  Correct.  

13      Q.  How far back?  

14      A.  Since -- I believe my first year down there was 

15  2017.  I believe that was my first year down there.  

16      Q.  So you've gone down there 2017 up until the present?  

17      A.  Yeah.  

18      Q.  Is it always about four weeks?  

19      A.  Yes.  

20      Q.  What are the accommodations?  Do you guys stay in 

21  the ranch house?  Do you set up tents?  Tell me about that.  

22      A.  When we first started going down there, we were in 

23  tents, and Jamie has built, pretty much, a hotel in the 

24  middle of nowhere.  So, we can house up to 35 people.  

25  There's a gaming room, guides' quarters, and then a hotel 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    167

 1  for the clients.  

 2      Q.  If a person were interested in taking that trip, is 

 3  there a website or something that they go to, to look that 

 4  up?  

 5      A.  Correct.  

 6      Q.  What's this called?  

 7      A.  Trails & Trophies.  

 8      Q.  And, so, these are clients that know the owner or 

 9  look it up on the website; they sign up for the trip, and 

10  they meet you folks down there in Mexico and go do the hunt?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  Do the hunters -- is this a four-week hunt, or do 

13  you have multiple hunters that come over the course of four 

14  weeks?  

15      A.  There's -- usually the hunts are about seven days, 

16  but there's -- every week there will be different clients 

17  that come in to hunt.  

18      Q.  So, if you have a client on a seven-day hunt there, 

19  do you -- do you take a pack, and do you go back out to get 

20  them, or do you always stay at that hotel thing that he 

21  built?  

22      A.  No.  The hunts down there are in a vehicle.  You're 

23  in a high rec; so you just get in the truck, and you just 

24  stand on the top of the truck and drive around.  You don't 

25  do any hiking or anything like that.  Usually, most animals 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    168

 1  that are shot are right of the road.  

 2      Q.  Are those animals that you shoot his animals that 

 3  are bred there?  

 4      A.  Depending on the high fence or the free range.  

 5  There are free-range hunts with wild animals, and then there 

 6  are high-fence hunts, but they usually do that in early part 

 7  of December late November.  

 8      Q.  Do you go to Mexico just one time a year?  

 9      A.  Yes.  

10      Q.  I think I asked you this, but I already forgot your 

11  answer.  Other than going to Mexico, do you go do any other 

12  hunts in a foreign location?  

13      A.  No, I do not.  

14      Q.  How about just recreationally, for yourself, do you 

15  do any of that type of hunting outside the state of Oregon?  

16      A.  Not outside the state of Oregon, no.  

17      Q.  How about in Oregon?  Are you a hunter yourself for 

18  your own hunting purposes here in Oregon?  

19      A.  Correct.  

20      Q.  Do you get tags every year?  

21      A.  Yes, I do.  

22      Q.  And did you get tags this past year?  

23      A.  Yes.  

24      Q.  What did you get?  

25      A.  Klamath mule deer and then just a general season elk 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    169

 1  tag.  Every year I buy a mountain lion and a black bear tag 

 2  just in case we see one.  

 3      Q.  Do you -- is that commonly -- is that, basically, 

 4  the way that you get your tags every year; you get a Klamath 

 5  mule deer and a general elk?  

 6      A.  Yeah.  I put in for premium tags, but I usually end 

 7  up getting, like, a local Klamath tag and a general elk tag.  

 8      Q.  Have you gotten any premium tags from 2022 to the 

 9  present?  

10      A.  No.  

11      Q.  Did you harvest an elk this year?  

12      A.  No.  

13      Q.  Did you last year?  

14      A.  Not an elk, no.  

15      Q.  When is the last time you got an elk?  

16      A.  I want to say 2018.  

17      Q.  Did you get a deer this year?  

18      A.  Yes.  

19      Q.  Is the tag for one buck?  

20      A.  One buck, yes.  

21      Q.  How about last year?  Did you get a buck?  

22      A.  Yes.  

23      Q.  Year before?  

24      A.  Yes.  

25      Q.  You've gotten your buck every year for a while?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    170

 1      A.  I hunt private property, so, yeah.  

 2      Q.  Yeah.  

 3      A.  Pretty spoiled.  All my buddies are mad.  I've got 

 4  like 5,000 acres that I hunt, and nobody else can hunt it, 

 5  so it's pretty easy to --  

 6      Q.  How do you have that connection?  

 7      A.  -- sit in the ground blind with my son and wait for 

 8  our deer.  

 9      Q.  How do you have that connection?  

10      A.  A friend of mine's parents own a big ranch out 

11  towards Bonanza.  It's not far off the road, and you can sit 

12  right there and catch your meat.  

13      Q.  Where do go to try to get your elk?  

14      A.  I used to hunt up in Wenaha.  That's where I 

15  actually harvested the big elk, but I hunt out in the flats 

16  here in Aspen outside of Round Lake.  

17      Q.  For -- it sounds like no, but let me ask:  For your 

18  deer hunts, do you pack in and camp?  

19      A.  No.  

20      Q.  How about for your elk?  When you go elk hunting, do 

21  you pack and camp?  

22      A.  No.  

23      Q.  Any other big game that you have harvested from 2022 

24  up to present?  

25      A.  No, nope.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    171

 1      Q.  How about fishing?  Are you a fisherman?  

 2      A.  I've taken my kids to Lake of the Woods, and we've 

 3  got, like, perch, but never -- I haven't been like salmon 

 4  fishing or anything like that.  

 5      Q.  All right.  Other than your hunting activities, what 

 6  other hobbies do you have that you do for enjoyment?  

 7      A.  Mainly just playing with my kids.  They're like my 

 8  best friends -- my wife and my kids.  I don't hang out with 

 9  buddies after work.  I don't do anything.  I spend all my 

10  time either around my house or with my kids at the park, and 

11  that's -- that's just what I spend my time with.  That's my 

12  enjoyment, so -- 

13      Q.  Are there -- I'm going to make a distinction here 

14  with these next couple questions, and the distinction is 

15  going to be between activities, that you used be able to do 

16  that you absolutely cannot do, versus activities that you 

17  used to do, that you can still do, but they are harder.  

18          Does that make sense?  

19      A.  Sure, yes.  I'm sorry.  

20      Q.  So let's start with that.  Are there any activities, 

21  that you used to do, that you just absolutely, flat out, "I 

22  cannot do these activities because of my groin problems"?  

23      A.  Well, start with swimming.  I'll start with playing 

24  tag, playing soccer with my son.  I'll start with hiking big 

25  hills; I can't do them.  I can't do it anymore.  I hunt the 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    172

 1  flats, and we walk slow.  There's just like -- I can't -- I 

 2  can't lift -- I can't lift the jumping jack back into my 

 3  truck.  I can't lift the plate whacker I used to lift into 

 4  the back of my truck.  You know, I can't lift heavy things 

 5  anymore.  

 6      Q.  Do you, currently today, for example, do you have 

 7  any sciatica going down your legs?  

 8      A.  I do not.  

 9      Q.  Do you get that, from time to time, when you do lift 

10  heavy things?  

11      A.  Yes.  

12      Q.  All right.  Any other activities, that you just used 

13  to do, that you absolutely just flat out cannot do, other 

14  than what you listed for me?  

15      A.  I think it's more of a -- for your next question, 

16  there are things I can't do that, I can do, but I'm in pain, 

17  but any kind of strenuous thing -- like, at work, we've got 

18  240-pound rolls of fabric; I used to be able to throw them 

19  over my shoulder, pack them, throw them in the ditch, start 

20  rolling rock out, and I can't do that anymore.  

21          You know, it's just -- I don't know if that goes 

22  under the category of lifting heavy things, but there's 

23  just -- yeah, along those lines, what I've told you, that's 

24  a lot of what I can't do.  

25      Q.  Tell me about the things that you can still do, but 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    173

 1  they are just much more difficult?  

 2      A.  I can -- I can go to work.  I can -- I can play with 

 3  my kids, but I'm still in pain.  I can sit up and fill out 

 4  my time cards, but it's just -- it's still painful to lean 

 5  forward.  Sitting for long periods of time, I can do; it's 

 6  just -- it starts hurting.  So having sex with my wife, for 

 7  instance, is something I can do, and I try to do; it just 

 8  hurts, something that I try to avoid because it hurts.  

 9  Things like -- I don't know -- keeping a positive attitude.  

10  It seems like I used to be the happiest person ever, you 

11  know, and the pain and the throbbing and stuff kicks in, and 

12  it's not as easy to be happy and hooting and hollering and 

13  being the fun guy on the job site anymore.  I've lost that.  

14  You know, that used to be me.  Everybody knew where I was, 

15  you know.  So, I don't know.  

16      Q.  What is it about sex that hurts?  

17      A.  I think it's more the motion, the frustration, 

18  the -- I don't know.  I don't feel handsome anymore, you 

19  know.  I don't feel like things look the same anymore, 

20  because they don't.  I don't -- I don't know.  There's the 

21  pain.  There's the mental part of it.  It's just -- I don't 

22  know.  

23          I -- I know that -- I just know that I love my wife, 

24  and I hope I never lose her, you know.  I hope that she 

25  stays strong, and we figure out what's going on with me.  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    174

 1  You know, I feel that, if we could get this pain to go away, 

 2  I will be back to who I used to be, you know.  I feel like a 

 3  lot of this that has happened to me has kind of ruined me as 

 4  a person.  So, I don't know how else to describe it.  

 5      Q.  Are you receiving any sort of mental health support?  

 6      A.  I'm not.  

 7      Q.  Have you gone to see a counselor at all about 

 8  anything?  

 9      A.  Not -- because I don't want to take any more 

10  medication.  I don't want to -- I just want to be back; 

11  that's all I want.  

12      Q.  Have you talked to Dr. Gonzales about seeing a 

13  counselor, or anybody, to talk through some of these issues 

14  with?  

15      A.  I don't feel like I get the medical care I used to 

16  get anymore.  I don't really feel welcomed, like not 

17  necessarily welcomed, but I just feel, like passed on to, 

18  like, another doctor.  Like Kristy, I think her name is, she 

19  helps me out.  It's like -- I don't know.  I just feel 

20  like -- as if I'm a complainer, and I've never been a 

21  complainer, you know.  I'm just trying to get through 

22  something that happened to me, and I just needed help -- 

23  need help.  I want the DRG stimulator to work, so I could go 

24  back to normal, you know.  

25          I don't want pain medication.  It hurts me.  It 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    175

 1  hurts my heart to take medication.  I've been against 

 2  medication my whole life, you know, and now I'm dependent 

 3  upon it for years.  What's after this, you know?  How are 

 4  they going to get me off this, you know?  I don't know.  

 5  I've gone through a lot in the last three years, and I just 

 6  hope one day this will all go away, and I can go back to who 

 7  I was.  That's all.  

 8      Q.  Okay.  Let me go back to your income.  So it looked 

 9  like, according to the W-2s, your income went down in 2023 

10  and then went back up in 2024.  

11          Can you just give me some sense of why that was?  

12      A.  I had two really good prevailing-wage projects.  I 

13  was working 14, 16 hours.  You can look at my time.  I, at 

14  least, have 30, 40 hours overtime of prevailing wage.  I had 

15  a press for deadlines on two projects.  I started two 

16  projects that were unrealistic deadlines to try to get them 

17  done.  

18          So, the amount of hours I worked to try to get them 

19  done was beneficial to, you know, where you can make 5 grand 

20  a week take-home compared to like, right now, I'm doing 

21  driveways at 1,000, $1,200 a week.  So, it depends a lot on 

22  what projects you're available to work on.  

23      Q.  Tell me about 2025 so far.  If 2025 continues the 

24  way it has for you, income-wise, do you think you're going 

25  to end up more than 2024 or less?  Do you get any sense?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    176

 1      A.  I'll probably make 50 grand, maybe, this year, if I 

 2  continue at the rate I'm going.  I think I've probably made 

 3  $15,000 this year.  

 4      Q.  Why the big difference --  

 5      A.  I'm not on -- 

 6      Q.  -- this year from last year?  

 7      A.  I'm not on a prevailing-wage project.  There was a 

 8  prevailing-wage project in Roseburg I had the opportunity to 

 9  do, but I can't work nights.  I can't work all night long.  

10  It was one of our biggest projects of the year.  It was, I 

11  believe, a four-month project.  I probably would have made 

12  100 grand in four months, but I'd be in pain the whole time 

13  and away from my family and just hurting and stuck in a tent 

14  or hotel and in pain.  I can't do it.  

15          And, then, I've got all this stuff going, doctors 

16  stuff going on.  I mean, I don't know what this DRG nerve 

17  stimulator, what all these doctors appointments are going to 

18  have to do, and I can't expect my boss to just continuously 

19  try to find someone else to go up there and replace me.  

20          So he ended up subbing it out to someone else 

21  because I just wasn't available.  He told me I'm the best at 

22  doing the sidewalks and the ADA ramps.  That's pretty much 

23  what I specialize in at Rocky Mountain, so I do them fast.  

24  I'm really good on an excavator, and I'm really good at what 

25  I do; everybody tells me that for the amount of experience I 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    177

 1  have.  So right now I'm doing, like, driveways and things 

 2  like that.  I wasn't able to take that job, so -- 

 3          MR. TUENGE:  All right.  Let's take a brief break.  

 4  I'm going to go over my notes, and we'll finish up.  

 5          THE WITNESS:  Okay.  

 6          MR. TUENGE:  Thanks.  

 7          VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're going off the record.  The time 

 8  is 1:10.

 9                (Break.)

10          VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on the record.  The time 

11  is 1:18.  

12          MR. TUENGE:  Okay.  We're back on the record after 

13  taking a break.  I don't have any more questions at this 

14  point.  I believe your attorney does.  I may have questions 

15  in follow-up.  Okay?

16      A.  Okay.  

17          MR. TUENGE:  Thanks for your time.

19                          EXAMINATION

20  BY MR. LINTHORST:  

21      Q.  I just have a few, Mr. Ricketts.  You've talked a 

22  lot about your employer, Rocky Mountain Construction, and I 

23  believe the word you used was "accommodating."  

24          Since your injury, they've been very accommodating; 

25  is that right?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    178

 1      A.  Correct.  

 2      Q.  Explain what you mean by "accommodating"?  

 3      A.  My boss has hired a laborer to help me do a lot of 

 4  different things that -- as to where most of the other guys 

 5  who do the same thing I do, they don't get a laborer to help 

 6  them do, so --  

 7      Q.  And I -- you know, we share the background working 

 8  in the trades, and you've talked a little bit about, you 

 9  know, the whole list of trades you've worked in.  

10          Would you say that your boss at Rocky Mountain and 

11  his accommodating nature is unique in the trade -- in the 

12  trades?  

13      A.  Yeah.  I'm considered the "golden boy" now; so, 

14  yeah, he -- he goes out of his way to make sure that I'm 

15  taken care of.  

16      Q.  Okay.  Is that something that's unique, to your 

17  experience, with Rocky Mountain Construction?  

18      A.  Yeah, because not everybody gets it.  

19      Q.  Yeah.  I do want to ask a little bit more about the 

20  procedure day.  At one point, when Mr. Tuenge was 

21  questioning you, you used the term, "abrupt," describing the 

22  end of the procedure, and I want to ask you a little bit 

23  more about that.  Okay?  

24      A.  Sure.  

25      Q.  If I have the timeline right, it sounds like 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    179

 1  Dr. Peters was working on you for about 30 minutes before 

 2  Rene brought Dr. Smith in; is that right?  

 3      A.  Correct.  

 4      Q.  Dr. Smith was there, at least in the room, for -- 

 5  for the next 30 minutes while Dr. Peters worked on you; is 

 6  that right?  

 7      A.  Correct.  

 8      Q.  And you're not clear whether Dr. Smith also did work 

 9  on you.  You couldn't see it, one way or the other; is that 

10  right?  

11      A.  Correct.  

12      Q.  And, then, I believe you said Dr. Smith had to leave 

13  to do another procedure; is that right?  

14      A.  Yes.  

15      Q.  How do you know why he was leaving?  

16      A.  Because he had over -- said something about doing a 

17  circumcision.  

18      Q.  Okay.  So about an hour into the procedure, 

19  Dr. Smith leaves.  

20          Do I have that right?  

21      A.  Correct.  

22      Q.  Did Dr. Peters continue to work on you when 

23  Dr. Smith was out of the room?  

24      A.  Yes.  

25      Q.  To the best of your knowledge -- I mean, I know you 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    180

 1  can't see what he's doing -- was he working on the left side 

 2  or the right side after Smith left?  

 3      A.  He said he was going to go to the right side and see 

 4  if he can get that.  

 5      Q.  And do you know about how long it took for him 

 6  working on the right side?  

 7      A.  Oh, it was pretty quick.  It was under 10 minutes.  

 8  It was -- it was pretty quick.  

 9      Q.  So you're about hour and 10 minutes, or so, into 

10  this procedure -- just estimating -- and was the procedure 

11  over when Dr. Peters finished with the right side?  

12      A.  No.  He said that he wanted to go back to the left 

13  side and just double-check and make sure that he had got it.  

14      Q.  Okay.  And did you object to that or agree with that 

15  or have any response at all?  

16      A.  No, I did not.  

17      Q.  Why not?  

18      A.  Because he's a doctor.  I just figured he -- he 

19  needed to do what he needed to do.  

20      Q.  Okay.  

21      A.  So -- 

22      Q.  So, about how long did he work on your left side the 

23  second time around?  

24      A.  Probably close to a half hour.  

25      Q.  Did Mr. Smith ever come back?  

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    181

 1      A.  Eventually, yes.  

 2      Q.  About how long after he said, "I'm going to go back 

 3  and take another look at the left side" -- about how long 

 4  was he working on you before Dr. Smith came back in the 

 5  room?  

 6      A.  If I had to put a time frame on it, I would say 

 7  probably a half hour.  

 8      Q.  And do you know how Dr. Peters let Dr. Smith know he 

 9  needed him to come back, or did he let him know he needed 

10  him to come back?  

11      A.  I overheard Dr. Peters ask Rene to go get Dr. Smith.  

12      Q.  Was she able to bring him back?  

13      A.  Not the first time.  

14      Q.  Okay.  If anything, we all want to know what you 

15  heard.  Did Rene come back with Dr. Smith, or what did she 

16  say when she came back?  

17      A.  She said that he was still doing a surgery and that 

18  he would be in as soon as he was done.  

19      Q.  Okay.  And did Dr. Smith eventually come back?  

20      A.  Correct.  

21      Q.  Did -- when Dr. Smith came back, what happened?  

22      A.  He just -- he just looked at what was going on and 

23  just told Dr. Peters that, "I think we're done."

24      Q.  Okay.  What did Dr. Peters do at that point?  

25      A.  Dr. Smith had walked out of the door, and Dr. Peters 

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    182

 1  grabbed something off the side.  I could see him reach for 

 2  something, which I believe is when he put a stitch -- I 

 3  believe that's what he did at that time.  

 4      Q.  Okay.  And then what happened next?  

 5      A.  He stood up and said, "You're free to go," and he 

 6  walked out.  

 7      Q.  And then what did you do?  

 8      A.  I -- I sat up, and then I realized that I still had 

 9  the gown and the -- I don't know if it's a surgical blanket.  

10  And I could see my testicles, and I pulled that all off of 

11  me and threw it on the floor.  I made my way over to the 

12  chair.  I grabbed my clothes.  I took the gown off.  I got 

13  myself dressed, and then I tried to -- I made it to the -- 

14  ended up making it to the hallway.  

15      Q.  Were you in a lot of pain at that point?  

16      A.  Yes, I was.  A lot.  

17      Q.  What did you do when you got to the hallway?  

18      A.  I started yelling.  

19      Q.  For what?  

20      A.  Help.  

21      Q.  Did somebody come help you?  

22      A.  A lady came around the corner and said, "Sir, you're 

23  free to go."

24      Q.  And what did you say, if anything?  

25      A.  "I can't walk."

                     CHRISTOPHER RICKETTS                    183

 1      Q.  Okay.  And is that when they brought a wheelchair?  

 2      A.  Correct.  

 3          MR. LINTHORST:  Those are all the questions I have.  

 4          MR. TUENGE:  I don't have any additional questions.  

 5          VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  This concludes today's 

 6  deposition of Christopher Ricketts.  We're going off the 

 7  record.  The time is 1:25.
