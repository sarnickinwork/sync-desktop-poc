I'm going to be sharing this a lot or attempting to. Foreign. I've got your driver's license on here's slide number two that y' all provided to me in discovery. Do you see that, Miss Light? Yes. You still have the same driver's license? Yes. It's got. Your date of birth is December 16, 1983. Is that accurate? Yes. I have it right here if you need to see it. I can't see my screen, though. You can't see your screen? I can't. I can't see me now that you have that up there. Okay. But I'm sure it's the same one. Okay. My bigger concern is can you see the screen I'm sharing? Yes, I can see the screen you're sharing. Okay. Thank you. You don't have any restrictions on your driver's license for anything? No. What's your vision like? I mean, I think I have pretty good vision. You don't wear glasses or contacts or never had eye surgery, correct? No. All right. And I want to get some background, more background information about you. You ever been involved in any other lawsuit before? No. Any other insurance claims, either bringing claims or somebody bringing A claim against you? I have had a couple other little claims. I got rear ended. Well, not rear ended, but a lady backed into me in a parking lot. Yeah? You get hurt? No. Okay. Just a property damage claim. Yeah. All right. And what else? Anything else?

You had any speeding tickets, moving violations, that type of thing? I got a ticket with this accident, but other than that, nothing. Thank you for sharing that. And what became of the citation that was issued to you in this case, disregarding traffic control device? I think it was. What. What. What became of that? It was dismissed in court with tr. With traffic school. All right. Did you get Travis to go over and help you out or did you go by yourself or get somebody else? We hired another lawyer. Sir. Did you get you good traffic lawyer? Yes. Who'd you hire? I don't remember his name. All right, fair enough. But when it was dismissed, did you have to plead to anything? Guilty, no contest, or they just get it dismissed? I believe it was just dismissed. Okay, fair enough. And then I hate to ask you this, but I got to. You ever been arrested? No. All right. Oh, And then I want to ask you about your insurance coverage. In a lawsuit. We're entitled to find out about insurance coverage. And Travis has been kind enough to send me yalls coverage showing that you've got coverage with USAA for 300,000 primary limits and $2 million umbrella. Do you see that? Yes. Is that all the insurance coverage that you're aware of that would provide coverage for any settlement or judgment in this case? Yes. Okay. And so do you accept any responsibility for causing the crash that's made the basis of this suit? No. Do you believe that there's anything that you could have done differently that would have prevented the wreck from happening? No. And when I say prevented direct from happening, I'm talking about the wreck of May 10, 2025. You understand that? Yes. All right, tell me in your own words, how did the wreck happen from your perspective? This is a very emotional topic for me. Take your time and let me know how it happened. My daughter and I needed to go to Kohl's to go buy a dress for her. So we left our house and we began driving. I go, I turn right on Windridge. There's a stop sign. I stop at the stop sign, I look left, I look right for pedestrians, and I look left again. I did not see anyone coming. So I pulled out into the intersection. You have to stop in the median in this intersection because there are trees everywhere. You have to stop in the median. Half to. When I stopped at the stop sign and I proceeded out into the intersection is when I saw Mr. Krausen. He was in the far right lane and he switched to the. To the left lane. When I saw him, I pushed down the accelerator to try to get out of his way. I did not see him when I pulled out. We ended up crashing and running into each other. When he. When he went into the left lane and I was going forward, I was trying to get to the median to get out of his way. You need to take a break. No, You're doing good, Katie. Thanks. It's very traumatic. I know it was. And take your time. If you need to take a break, that's fine. If not, we'll sit here and give you as much time as you want to finish how it happened. Okay? That is how it happened. Okay. Are you. Are you done? Okay. I was going forward. I didn't see him. All right, so let me go back and ask you some questions. Okay? Okay. So if the. Crash had not happened, I pulled from Google Maps, this is my slide number five. And it's put a general red dot here where Windridge Place intersects with Resort Research Forest Drive. You see that? Yes, sir. And so you were going to head to Kohl's. That's K O H L s correct? Yes, sir. To get address for your daughter Julia, right? Yes, sir. And so, as I understand what you're saying, you would have come up here to this intersection if this had not happened and your intention was to make a left hand turn on Research Forest. Yes, sir. Where in general on this map, if it's shown is Coles. You would go down right. You would turn right on Greenbridge Drive. Yes, ma'. Am. Keep going all the way down. And you would turn. Keep going. And you would turn right on 242. Is that the same as College Park Drive? Yes, sir. Yes, ma'. Am. And Kohl's is close to the freeway on the left hand side, more or less. A long ways or short ways from what we've got on the map to the freeway. I don't. I think here's where it ends. I don't know what that. What this is right here. Some baseball fields over here to the left. So it would. It would continue down 242. That's a. That's a sports perk. Yeah, I know you don't know exact distance, but would it have been 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes? You got any. Can you give me some estimate? I'm trying to figure out how long the intended trip was going to be. It's about a 15 minute drive. Fair enough. And so the next question I. I want to know is you live back in this neighborhood off of Windridge Place, correct? Yes, sir. And I'm just wanting to know where you coming from. Is your home up here on North Floral Leaf Circle back here to the top of this picture or down here to the bottom? To the bottom. All right. So. And I'm guessing it's not too far where your home is up to where you take a right on Windridge Place. Yes. True. Couple minutes or whatever, right? Yes. And you would have taken a right onto Windridge Place. Yes. And you would have come up here to this stop sign where I'm got this red dot, correct? Yes, sir. All right, and that's slide six we were looking at. And then here is. I'm pulling these images here from Google Maps. Slide 7 has got a picture of the stop sign where Windridge Place intersects with Research Forest. Is that right? Yes, sir. I'm trying to figure out when you say at the stop sign, the stop sign's offset from the Research Forest Drive, Correct? Say that again. This stop sign you see here. Huh. It's a little ways back from the intersection of Research Forest Drive. True? Yes. When you say you stopped at the stop sign that day, where did you stop? At the stop sign. I mean, I stopped at the stop sign. There's no limit line there. So, like, I stop before I go out in the road. You have to stop. I know, and that's what I'm. I'm trying to figure out is the stop sign. Here is slide number eight. It's got a car that's back here at the stop sign. You see that in slide 8? Yes. And then it's got quite a bit of room from the stop sign out to the. The road surface. You see where my dot is out here at the road surface? Yes. What I want to know is on that day, where, first of all, where did you first stop? Did you only make one stop before getting on to Research Forest Drive before the wreck happened, or more than one stop? I don't recall. But. But you stopped before getting on to Research Forest Drive, correct? Definitely. Okay, you see this photograph here? Yes. Where is it that you stopped? Your best estimate Back here where this car is. I mean. Yeah, probably pretty close. Okay, so. Your testimony today is you would have stopped back here where this car is, that I'm putting the red line, correct? Yeah, I mean, roughly, you have to, you have to be able to see around. So wherever that is in that picture. So on slide 8, I've marked in red where you say that you stopped back by the stop sign, correct? Yeah, I stopped at the stop sign. Thank you. Okay. And here's another view again. Here's the, the outline of the stop sign over here. And I've got, I want to show you right here you would have stopped if this is the stop sign where this arrow is in slide number nine, you would have stopped back here is what your testimony is, Correct. I would have stopped where I could have seen to turn left. Okay. I. So list. That's what I'm trying to figure out. So here is a view. This is slide number 10. This is a view from Google Maps. If you stop at that stop sign, that's the view that a motorist would have. Is that where you stopped? I mean, I may have paused there for a second and moved up. I don't, I would not have turned left from a view of that. Okay. You can't see down at all. That would be dangerous, right? Definitely. That would be paying Russian roulette, right? Definitely. I have a 12 year old daughter in my car. There was no way I would have done anything to hurt her. I understand. And I'm just trying to get your best memory. Okay. Because I only get to talk to you once to figure out your best memory of how this happened. That's all I'm trying to do. So. You believe that you would have pulled forward from this view because over to the left it would have been blocked off by the trees, right? Yes. Okay. Would not have turned from that. From that vantage point. And you gave a statement to your representative after this collision and you told us what everybody knows. There's lots of trees in the woodlands, right? Yes. And these trees like we just saw, they keep you from seeing who's coming, right? The trees and. Yeah. The curvature of the road as well. So what you want to do as a safe motorist is to make certain that you get your vehicle in a position where you can see people before getting on to Research Forest Drive, right? Yes. So here's another view. This is slide number 12. And I've got a red block here. I, I was hoping that you could tell me from this overhead view where you think you were positioned before Entering onto Research Forest Drive, where you stopped, were you? Here's the stop sign. See where I put the little red deal at the bottom? Yes. In relation to this stop sign, were you here? Were you out here? Where were you? I was probably a little bit further up. I would not have turned if I did not. If I could not clearly see down research. All right, You've lived there for about six years, right? Yes. Do you stop. Do about the same thing every. Every single day? When you're leaving that subdivision? Say that again. When you're leaving that subdivision, do you pull up about the same place every day? Yeah, I guess everyone does. Where do you pull up? You've done it literally hundreds, if not thousands of times. Where'd you pull up this morning, if you. Or yesterday? Well, to be honest, I have not gone through that intersection since then. Okay, you go out a different way now? Yes. All right, and why is that? Because I have extreme PTSD from that intersection. All right. Before this collision, you had been driving this intersection for long time, right? Yes. Had you ever had any close calls there before? No. Did you believe it to be a dangerous intersection before this occurred? I mean, there's a lot of intersections in the woodlands that are not the best. We have a lot of trees. Did you believe that this was a dangerous intersection before this wreck occurred? No. Had you ever heard of anybody having collisions there before this happened? I don't know. You weren't aware of any collisions that had ever taken place there before? I was not aware of any collisions. So if you were to give me your best estimate in looking at this slide number 12, where would you place this red vehicle? If it signifying your. Your truck, where would you say that it was positioned on the date of this wreck? Your best memory? Well, sir, I would have pulled up so I could have seen. Right. So where would that be? I've got the red truck. You tell me where to drop it. Somewhere in there, probably. Okay. You'd have pulled up ahead of that stop sign so you could get in a better position to see, right? Yes, probably. All right. Is this a fair place to. To put the truck? Because I have never been there. I'm trying to get your best estimate. Yeah. All right. It's not a very well placed stop sign, in my opinion. Yes, ma'. Am. So you face that situation before in the many years you've been on this earth driving, when you've come to a stop sign and you can't get a good look at approaching traffic, what are you supposed to do? Can you repeat the question. When the stop sign is not in a place where you can see, what are you supposed to do? You always have to look and you always have to stop at a stop sign. Yeah. And you have to be able to see the traffic that's approaching or near that intersection before you can pull out. That's the safe thing to do, right? Yes, obviously. All right, so when you got up to the stop sign, you said that you looked left, then you looked right, then you look back to the left, correct? Yes. How long did that take you to look left, right, left? I don't know. I mean, left, right, left. I'm looking. Okay. I look for pedestrians. We have a lot of pedestrians in the Woodlands as well. Okay. That's another reason that you want to get up here and make certain that you can see, because you don't want to run over any pedestrians walking or running down that. Is this a. Is this a pedestrian path where I've got my cursor? It's a shoulder. Yes. And that's where the pedestrians are that you were looking for to the right? Yeah. Well, yeah. So if you're back here at this stop sign, And I'm looking here at the. At this slide we looked at before, view from the stop sign, slide 10. That's not a real safe place to be either, because there could be pedestrians coming down these. This walkway here to the shoulder. And you want to make certain you don't run over them when you get to the road, right? Yes. So when you pulled up here and you look left, this is slide Again, slide number 12. And you get positioned, you see there's traffic on this road in slide number 12. That's headed east, right? Yes. There's three cars right here. See these three cars headed east? Yes. Your plan was to head north into the median over here and take a left, correct? Yes. So from the position here, while you're stopped before you started to enter onto the roadway, You see where I've marked CROs in back here? Yes. If he were in this position anywhere, that up here on the right is Greenbridge. You see where I've got Green Bridge up here? Yes. You know from times past that if you pull up here and you're looking, you can see all the way down here to Greenbridge, can't you? Yes. You can see vehicles down here at the stoplight. See this white vehicle down here that's parked at the stoplight at Green Ridge. Greenbridge. Yes. So if there is any traffic between Windridge Place and Green Bridge, if you're positioned Correctly, you ought to be able to see them, correct? Yes. Just like if there's any vehicle. If Mr. Croson's motorcycle was where I have it positioned, just happened to stick it there on number 12. If it was happened to be there, you should have seen him. Right? You're looking for. You can answer. There. I looked. I did not see any oncoming traffic. Yes, ma', am. I understand that it was a sunny. Day, and there were lots of shadows cast on the road. There's a curvature in the road. I didn't see him. Need to take take a break. That's okay. But my question is a little bit different. If you were looking you and you were paying attention, you should have been able to see traffic between Windridge Place and Greenbridge. Isn't that true? Yes, I should have. I should have been able to see him, but I did not see him. He was very camouflaged. You know that MO that motorcycle has a headlight that comes on automatically when you start it up. Did you ever see a headlight headed your way? I never saw a headlight. All right, as you're looking back to the left, before you pulled out onto Research Forest Drive, were there any other vehicles that you saw eastbound? No. How long did you sit at the stop sign area that we see in slide 12, more or less, before you decided to pull out? Well, I looked left, and I looked right, and I looked left, and I felt it was safe to go across to stop in the median where you have to stop. I did not see any oncoming traffic. All right. Have you seen the vehicle download from your Tacoma? Am I allowed to answer that question? Yes. My lawyer. Okay. Yes, you're allowed to answer that. Have you seen the vehicle download on your vehicle? Yes. I mean, I. I haven't seen it in person, but. Okay, we're going to look at that in a minute. The reason I asked, how long you sat there, the vehicle download I'll hold out to you, appears to show that you stop for about a second. If that's true, then you're look to the left, look to the right, look back to the left. That would have happened very quickly, correct? I didn't see anyone coming, sir. That would have happened very quickly. Correct. Left, right, left. True. Yeah. I guess. We're going to skip slide 13. Okay. At some point, you decided to enter into or onto Research Forest Drive to go over to the median, intending to turn left, right? Yes. Correct? Yes. And you. You've told us that you saw the motorcycle before you got to the median, correct? Yes. So this is slide number 14. And what I want to do here. Whoops. Is get you to help us position where your vehicle was approximately when you first saw his. His motorcycle, which was it at the edge of the roadway? Was it in one of the lanes? Was it in the. It was in one of the lane. It was like, in the first lane. Approaching the second lane. In the first lane. Tell me where to put the vehicle. You see it. A little bit farther back. Like I had left the stop sign. Yeah. Like right around there. I had already. Is that a fairly good estimate that you have in your mind today, where your vehicle was positioned when you first saw the Croson motorcycle headed your way? Roughly. Yes. Thank you. That's slide number 14. All right. And when you saw him. I've placed this yellow box here. I want you to help me position. Where was the motorcycle approximately? It was in the far right lane. Far right lane. All right. Like, in the far right lane. Like, keep going. Yeah. Well, here's the shoulder over here. When I get the blow up, you'll see what I'm doing. But I get it. You're in the far right lane. And. But where is it farther back? Was it closer? It happened so quick, I don't even know. I only remember watching him go from the far right lane to the left lane. Fair enough. So what I'm going to do. Attempt to do. While you're sitting there. You saw him go from the far right lane, where I've got it positioned, and you saw him go into the left lane? Yes. Okay. And I'm arbitrarily putting the distance between you and him because we don't know where you were. But it went to the left lane. I'm putting it. There's another Croson. I'm going to type croson2. Attempt to. Signifying he went into the left lane, correct? Yes. And again, we're looking at slide 14. So when Croson goes into the left lane, what were you doing? Where. Where's your vehicle when he goes to the left lane? I was right there when he. Okay. And I slammed on the gas to try to get out of his way into the median. Okay, so. What you did. So I don't move that. You slammed on the gas and went towards the median, right? Yes. You have to stop at the median. So I have marked a second box farther north on slide 14, signifying the second red box there. Red rectangular box signifies your movement when you saw when. When Croson was in the left lane, correct? Yes. Okay, got it. Okay. And I think we've already covered this. Slide 15. You believe, I think you're saying, that you only remember stopping once when after you got on to Windridge Place, before you got on to Research Forest Drive. You don't remember stopping twice or anything else, Right? I don't recall if there was anything on Windridge Place. I know I stopped at the stop sign. Where we've got you positioned in the earlier slides. Correct where you're trying to see? Yes. All right. Okay. Slide 16. We've already been through it. We're not going to go into that anymore. Okay. The point of impact. Was the point of impact, and this is not going to be exactly precise, but the point of impact, was it in the median over here, or was it in the. This left lane over here to your memory? I don't know. Somewhere right in there. And here's what I'm trying to find out. The police officer on his diagram, he's got the point of impact in the left lane. Do you think it was in the left lane or it was in the media? I don't know. Or do you know? I don't know. Thank you. Here's a picture, number 18, which has got your pickup and the motorcycle. You see it? Yes. Did you see the impact? Yes. And if you need to take a break, that's. That's fine. You want to take a quick break, Edith? It's okay. Let's take a quick break. About five, ten minutes. Okay, let's do five minutes. That's good. Okay, Going off the record right now, for the moment, at approximately 10:54am okay, we are back on the record. The time is approximately 1102am you may proceed. Slide. Are you ready to proceed again? Yes. So what do you remember about when the motorcycle hit the. Hit your door? I remember slamming into my door and glass shattered all over my face. Did you see the motorcycle as it was approaching, or were you looking straight ahead or what? And I think I saw it out of the corner of my eye. I was trying to get to the median. Yes, ma'. Am. You're trying to get out of the way, right? Yes. And what I'm trying to focus on is whether you saw the movement of the motorcycle as it's headed towards you. Was it sliding? Was it still upright when it hits you? Do you know any of that? I believe he was still upright. Okay. And I'm trying to figure out if you saw what part of his motorcycle strike your door was. It is like the front end of it, the side of it. Do you Know, I believe it was the front end. All right. Do you have any idea what broke your windshield? Your. Your window on the driver's side? Was it his helmet? The motorcycle? Do you have any idea? I don't know. Just the impact. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. I don't know. Just the impact. Okay. Okay. From the time that you saw him after you pulled out into that first lane until the time that the wreck happened, do you have an estimate of how long that took? I don't know. And from your memory to my understanding, once you saw him, You decided, I'm going to hit the gas to try to. Try to evade him, right? Yes. You didn't hit the brakes. Do that again. It. You don't have any memory of hitting the brakes, you decided to accelerate and try to evade the. The wreck, right? I don't think I did. Right. As this is going on, and I hate to ask this, but I need to know it. What. What was your child saying or reacting, if at all, while this is going on before the impact? I don't recall if there was any interaction. All right, y' all were both belted, I take it? Of course. And Julia usually rides up here in the front end with you? I don't allow my children in the front seat until they're 12, because I know that back seat is best. Okay. And. At the time of the impact, did Julia say anything or scream or do anything at that time? Well, at the time of impact, I got shattered. The glass shattered all over my face. So I had blood all over my face, I think she said, like, oh, my gosh or something. Okay, what about her? Was she. Her. She had a few nicks from the glass, but I took all of it. And how bad were the cuts on your face or wherever else on your body? My eyes were completely full of glass. I had cuts on my chin and in my lip, and I had some in my scalp as well. I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have to get medical attention for all that? I would imagine I. The paramedics helped flush out some of the glass out of my eyes. I did go to urgent care afterwards because I still felt like I had glass in my eyes, and they were still very irritated. And how long did they stay irritated or whatever else happened to them? A few days. I was picking glass out of my hair and my lips and my face for days. Sure. That was an awful experience. Did that eventually heal up, or do you still have any problems from that? It eventually healed up all right. And it's obviously affected you emotionally, and I'm sorry that it has. If you had to get counseling or anything because of it. I have. Yes. Well, I pray that. That. That you're able to overcome that. And. And I hope and pray that you do. All right. Thank you. I need to talk to you about what we call the rules of the road. Before I get there. Did you talked to the police officer afterwards? Correct. I don't remember really talking to the police officer. I know that he was there. I was in a state of shock after the incident happened. Okay. Have you seen the police report? My husband has seen the police report. I have been. I did not look at the police report though. Okay. And I don't want to know anything about what you, Travis, has told you. That's privilege. I'm gonna show that to you in a minute. The. I can share this screen again. Okay. I want to show you transportation code section 544.010, dealing with stop signs and yield signs. And. It says the important part of it, the operator of a vehicle approaching in a. Approaching an intersection with a stop sign shall stop is provided by subsection C. And subsection C says in the absence of a clearly marked stop line or crosswalk, the operator shall stop at the place nearest the intersecting roadway where the operator has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. Do you see that? Yes. And you understand that's what the law requires? If. If here there wasn't. There's no stop line there at that stop sign there on Windridge, right? I don't believe so. So what the law requires you to do is you. You're obligated to stop at the place nearest the intersecting roadway here, Research Forest Drive. So you've got a view of approaching traffic, correct? Yeah, that's the rule. Stop at all stop signs always. Yeah, but not as the stop sign. You've got to stop where you can see. Yes. Stop where you can see. Right. So that's the rule. And then that's slide 19. And on slide 20, the state law, transportation code section 545.153, vehicle entering stop or yield intersection, says that there's a preferential right of way at an intersection may be indicated by a stop sign, meaning that here, Research Forest Drive, traffic had the preferential right of way over the traffic coming off of Windridge. You understood that, correct? Yes. And an operator approaching an intersection on a roadway controlled by a stop sign after stopping as required by section 544 0.010. That's what we just looked at shall reel the right of way to a vehicle that has entered the intersection from another highway or that is approaching so closely as to be an immediate hazard to the operator's movement in or across the intersection. Do you see that? Yes. And you, you knew that. That's just basic stuff we learn when we're 16 year olds and driving a car, right? Yes. You can't get on the road if you got traffic that's coming your way that might be a hazard to you or the people in the car, right? Yes. Or hazard to the traffic, the drivers, the. The drivers on the road, right? Yes. So I want to see if we can agree on some, just some basic rules of the road that you and I and Travis and everybody's got to follow. You gotta. Number one, this is slide number 21. Yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, right? Yes. Come to a complete stop at stop signs, right? Yes. And you can't see at the stop sign. You got to stop at the place nearest the roadway to have a clear view. That's. That's rule three, right? Yes. Number four, you. You must not interfere with approaching traffic, True? Yes. You gotta stop. Rule 5, you gotta stop before getting on that road. So you gotta stop long enough to see what's coming, right? Yes. Rolling stops may not be a good idea. Especially getting on Research Forest Drive, True? Yes. Then you can proceed only when it's safe, right? Yes. And then rule seven, you do not block the right lane of traffic. Rule 8, you can't block the left lane of traffic. And you can't block both lanes of traffic when you get out onto Research Force Drive thru. Yes. And those rules apply even if the vehicle coming down resource Research Forest drive is going 25, 45 or 105 miles an hour, right? Yes. It's no excuse to get out onto the Research Forest Drive. And if, if the traffic is happens to be going fast, that makes it even the greater the need to use more caution. Right. Let me repeat that. Your lawyer has provided some photographs that from somebody. And this is slide number 22. Says approximate maximum site distance from stop sign at Windridge and Research forest drive is 350ft. The speed limit on research forest drive is 45 miles an hour. At 45 miles an hour it takes 5.3 seconds to cover 350ft. And they've written location of Katie Like's vehicle at the stop sign on written ridge place. And they've got it place there on slide 22 with a red box. You see that yes. You see this red box? Yes. Okay. I'll tell you all that just to get that into the record. So a nice. So I can ask you a question. Did you participate when they were putting this together? Do you. Do you have personal knowledge from looking at Google Maps that this distance 350ft is correct or not? My husband made those, I believe. Thank you. And did. It's up here in the upper right hand corner. It's got 352ft. Did he just use the Google app to do that measurement? I assume so. And then the location of K like's vehicle is. Is put here. Where did he get the information that's where your vehicle was spotted from you, or did he just decide to put it there? Where that come from? I don't know. All right, thank you. You remember giving a statement to the representative after this collision about five days later, and you told the representative that, that your best estimate of where this motorcycle was when you first saw it was seven or eight car lengths. And then later on you said about 200ft. And you. And you did say that you're not the best estimate of distances, but that. That's the words you used, right? I guess. I don't remember. So if you can see 350ft and the motorcycle, was it 200ft when you entered onto the roadway, you do you believe that you should have been able to see him before you did? I did not see him. Yes, ma', am. I understand that. But do you believe that you should have seen him before you did? I. I just didn't see him. Okay. This is slide number 23 in the statement that you gave to your representative. You were asked, could there have been anything blocking your view of him? And you told him, I can almost see there's a stoplight that is down there and I can almost see the stoplight from there. Talking about Greenbridge, correct? I believe so. Is that still your testimony there? There was really nothing that you remember that was blocking your view of approaching traffic, eastbound traffic, on the date of the wreck? True. Well, there's shadows, there's foliage behind him. He's in all black. There's a curve in the road. Did you know that Justin Croson had pulled up to that stoplight on Greenbridge and had stopped on at that light and had waited on the red light immediately before this collision? No. If he had. If you were looking and he was at the light, you should have been able to see him, Correct? You can answer if you know, I. Did not see him. Here's A picture, slide 24 of 37, taken from a vehicle that has positioned itself on Windridge. And on the. In the camera, you can see a vehicle down here at the Green Bridge intersection. You see that vehicle down there? Yes. And here's a zoom in of it. So if you position your vehicle correctly, you can see all the way down to Green Bridge, right? Yes. This vehicle in particular is turning left, though. And that's basically what you told us in slide 23. Again, in this statement, you told your representative five days afterwards that you can almost see there's a stoplight that is down there. And I can almost see the stoplight from there. Right. Yeah. That true? Sir, can I tell you what happened to us after within 48 hours of this accident? Sure, go ahead. It's been just one traumatic thing after another. Less than 48 hours after this accident, my husband's stepfather had a massive heart attack. He was resuscitated 13 times on that Monday. 13 times. He was in and out of ICU the entire summer. He went to a nursing facility. He ultimately was hospitalized for the final time at the end of the summer, where he was put on hospice. And we watched him take his final breaths. Trying to give my statement a couple days after all of this has happened is extremely traumatic. I understand. While that was going on, Justin Croson was lying in the hospital. So it's been hard on him, too. In all fairness. I completely understand. I have felt for Mr. Krausen every single day. I have prayed for this man every single day. I have felt his pain. Yes, ma', am. I understand. And hopefully we'll get this thing resolved. And we have offered to give you a full and final release. I'll just let you know that in case you didn't, with your insurance company can get the case settled. So I'm hoping that this will lead to that. All right. Okay. So that we don't have to mess with it anymore. Okay. We've got a few more minutes. And Then here, slide 25 is another view from the roadway edge that you up here in the upper right, I believe, is the actual camera distance. And the one on the left just shows us zoomed in where you can see traffic down there by Green. Greenbridge. You see that? Yes. And the statute again, requires you to get position like we see in slide 25, so that you've got a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. That's what you're required to do. True? Yes. I need to get you to answer when you get through. Taking a sip. In the absence of clearly marked stop sign? Is that what you're asking? You need to get up to the edge of the roadway like we see on slide 25. So you can see the traffic coming, right? Yes. You have to have a view. All right. When. This is slide number 26. This is a Google image that the Google truck has taken as it's entering into that first lane that you would have. Is this basically the view you would have had as you entered on to Research Forest Drive that day? Yeah. When you looked in relation to that vehicle that we see in this. Photograph in exhibit slide 26, do you have any estimate of where Mr. Croson's motorcycle was in relation to this first car that I'm circling with the red dot? I don't know. I'm not good with distances. He was quickly approaching, and I tried to get out of his way. Yes, ma'. Am. Was he closer than this car? I don't. I don't know. You don't know have any estimate as to where he would have been positioned on looking at this photograph? True. It's not a very good photograph, sir. You see the light down here at Green Ridge Green Bridge? Yeah, kind of. So if I ask you this question at trial or if your lawyers ask you this question at trial, you're not going to be able to tell us where Mr. Crosin was. Looking back towards Greenbridge on what section, what part of the roadway? Drew objective form. You can answer. I mean, he was probably where that first car was. Maybe. I don't. It's hard to tell. I didn't see him, though, when I pulled out. But this. This is slide 26 is when somebody has pulled out and they're in that right lane. And so that's what I'm asking. You said that you saw him when you entered into the roadway about this position. And you. To my understanding, you just told me that you think he was positioned about where this car is, where I've got the red cursor. Is that true or not? I don't know. I guess. Okay. I'm gonna put it there anyway. With understanding that you're saying that you're not real sure that's your best estimate. Would that be accurate? Yeah. I need to get your answer, ma'. Am. Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Yes. I'm. I still didn't hear you. Yes or no? Yes. Thank you. Okay. This is the answers to interrogatories. I'm going to ask you about one. One part of this statement interrogatory number two, which is the written answers that your lawyers supplied to us. I stopped at the stop sign at Windridge Place and Research Forest Drive. True. That's what happened, right? Yes. You looked left, right, then left again. I did not see any oncoming traffic, so I proceeded northbound on the Research Forest Drive. That's what. What they wrote for you? True. Yes. I crossed the first lane of traffic when I noticed plaintiff riding eastbound on his motorcycle, and I hit the gas in order to avoid a collision. That's. That's your statement today, correct? Yes. I crossed the first two lanes of Research Forest driving, came to a full stop at the median, dividing eastbound traffic from westbound traffic on Research Forest Drive. True. That's what you did, right? I did. I don't think I came to a full stop. I believe I was still going when he hit me. All right, thank. That's what I wanted to clarify. Thank you for saying that. And then this last sentence, it says, I was preparing to turn left on Research Forest Drive when I felt plaintiff impact my vehicle. That's. That's not accurate, is it? I was preparing to turn left. No. All right, thank you. Then the motorcycle speed, in the statement that you gave to your representative five days later on page seven, he asked you, do you know how fast he was traveling? And you said, I mean, he appeared to be going very quickly. Quickly coming up on me. I don't. I don't know. How many question do you know? And then it's got a question mark. And then answer. The speed limit is 45 on research for us. That's what you. The words typed in that statement. True? Yes. And so I just want to ask you, do you have any speed estimate today as to how fast he was going when you saw him? I have no idea. You don't know whether it was 25, 35, 45, 55. You just don't have an estimate? True. No. Did Mr. Croen, after the collision, what was his state? Was he knocked out? Was he talking? Did he stand up? Tell me about how he was doing. He was crying, in pain. Was he on the ground? Was he standing up? What. Tell me what happened to him after the collision. He was on the ground. Did you get out and try to assist him in any way? I was in shock. Sir. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. He was in shock, or you were in shock? I was in shock. All right. All right. Were you able to help him or. Or you weren't because you were in a state of shock? Tell me more about that, please. I did not help him. I was in a state of shock. All right, did you stay in your vehicle? No, I did not. Where did you go? Well, after the accident happened, we exited out the passenger side. Right. And your daughter, she was able to get out okay? Yes. And how was she reacting? We were both in shock. All right, y' all get out on the curb. Where'd y' all go after the wreck? We went to the median. Okay. On the other side from where he was, right? Yes. Did you call 911 or did somebody else call 911? What happened? I had my cell phone in the center console. I always keep it there for emergencies. And I was in such a state of shock that I couldn't even figure out how to unlock my phone. I tried to call 91 1, but I couldn't even unlock my phone. Okay, you never talked to him or heard him make any statement there or anywhere since the crash? True, True. That's true. I'm sorry, Yes, I have not. All right, were there any witnesses that you're aware of that said they saw everything, how it happened? I don't know. All right, you're not aware of anybody either that day or since then that have said I. I saw what happened? True. I don't know of anyone. Okay. The police officer made a report, got your name on it, and he. He's made some statements in the investigators narrative. One of the things he says is, unit one, that's you operator stated she misjudged the speed of unit two and continued into the intersection. You see where that's written in that report? I don't see. Weird thing. Maybe I'm not sharing it. Hold on. Sorry. We're about done. In the police report. I'll read it again. Unit one operator stated she misjudged the speed of unit two and continued into the intersections. What it says, Drew? That is what it says. Okay. And so my question is, do you remember talking to him about that or not? I do not remember talking to him. I remember him being present. I remember being in the ambulance. They have all these probes hooked up all over me. I remember the paramedic asking my name. My daughter is sitting there or my eyes are full of glass. My daughter looks like she's about ready to just burst into tears. I don't remember talking to the police. I remember him there, but I don't remember anything that I said to him. My husband tells me that I talked to him outside of the paramedic, but I don't even remember him Being there either. Okay. So your husband was able to come to the scene while y' all were still out there? Yes. Since this crash has happened, have you talk to your husband about anything he knows about how the crash happened or what you have told him about how it happened? I don't understand your question. Yeah. If you talk to him about how the wreck happened. I mean. Yeah. Did you tell him the same thing that you've told me and deposition today? Yes. Have you ever told anybody you misjudged the speed of the motorcycle? I don't recall. And then earlier I told you that the officer had the point of impact you see in this slide, number 30. He's got the point of impact out there in the left lane of Research Forest Drive. And it's your belief that the impact happened over here in the media intrude? Well, you can look back at the pictures. Yeah. Where the. Where the picture we looked at earlier, it showed a picture of your vehicle in the median and the motorcycle stood up next to it. You remember that one? Yes. You believe that's where the impact occurred? True. I did not move forward after the impact. Thank you. So that picture that's got. That we've seen, that you didn't move forward after. After impact, that's where everything ended up, and that's where that picture was taken. True. True. You want me to give you another question? Do you understand the question? Can you ask me again? Is that where the impact occurred, where that picture was taken? Yes. We did not move forward. Who took that picture, do you know? My husband. Okay. Do you blame anybody else? And we're not talking about my client right now. We're talking about others, like the neighborhood association or the Woodlands for the way that intersection is set up? No. Did you understand my question? Yeah. No. I have no one to blame. Okay. You have never gone to the city council in the Woodlands or the neighborhood association and told them that that intersection is dangerous and they need to do something about it? Somebody was hurt out there. Truth? No, I've never done that. I think you've referenced this. You weren't on your cell phone at the time. True. I don't talk on my cell phone during car, when I'm in the car or mess with it at all. Do you blame Justin Croson for causing the wreck? No. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. No. You're not going to tell the jury that you think he was negligent, right? No. You're not going to tell the jury that you think he could have done something to avoid the collision, are you? No. That he could have done something differently to in the manner in which he tried to avoid hitting you. You're not going to say, say that, are. You? Okay, well, you made it through it. I'm sorry that you've had to relive this. Do you have anything that you want to change in your testimony or think that I really need to know about something? I don't think so. All right, Well, I wish you the best. I hope this is the last that you've got to deal with any of this. And I hope we can get this thing settled. And I hope USAA will get you a full and final release. And I wish you the best going forward. Okay. Thank you, sir. Oh, we'll reserve. Before we go off the record. Travis, are you going to need a copy of the transcript? I'll take any. Trans would be great. Thank you, Lisa. Thank you. And does she need to read and sign? She will. Okay. And then let me grab your info in the chat so I can send everybody this PowerPoint. What do we want to do on the video? Just. Do you want to sync this one or do you want to go ahead and sync it for now? Yeah, it's just 15, isn't it? Go ahead and sync it. Yeah, this is Leah, because this is like. Yeah, okay. Still waiting on some transcripts for your other ones, Joe. So just. Going off of the record now, the time is 12:42 or, I'm sorry, 11:42am.",
